      "Why the committee made the recommendations \n",
      "Overall, there was limited new evidence on the accuracy of different methods of \n",
      "measuring blood pressure. Most of the studies identified were small, and the populations \n",
      "and protocols for measurement varied making interpretation difficult. However, the \n",
      "committee agreed that it was important to focus on the evidence from these more recent \n",
      "studies (post-2000) because the evidence should reflect the current use of electronic \n",
      "sphygmomanometers, which have replaced mercury-based sphygmomanometers. \n",
      "The evidence did not show that changing the current blood pressure thresholds for clinic \n",
      "measurement or home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) would improve diagnostic \n",
      "accuracy compared with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), so the committee \n",
      "agreed the 2011 thresholds for diagnosis should be retained. The committee noted that \n",
      "these are in line with most international guidance. \n",
      "Limited evidence suggested that clinic blood pressure measurement is less accurate than \n",
      "HBPM or ABPM when used to diagnose hypertension. The committee members \n",
      "acknowledged that these findings were in line with their clinical experience and agreed \n",
      "that clinic blood pressure measurement alone would not be an adequate method to \n",
      "diagnose hypertension. \n",
      "The committee discussed repeat clinic blood pressure measurements when there is a \n",
      "difference in blood pressure between arms and noted that clinical practice varied. Based \n",
      "on their experience and knowledge, the committee members agreed that a cut-off of \n",
      "15 mmHg would be more suitable than 20 mmHg, which was specified in the 2011 \n",
      "recommendations. This is in line with recent evidence that suggests a small difference in \n",

      "committee's experience and knowledge, it was agreed that ABPM remains the gold \n",
      "standard for the accurate measurement of blood pressure in primary care. ABPM has \n",
      "therefore been retained as the preferred method for the diagnosis of hypertension. In \n",
      "addition, economic evidence obtained by updating the health economic model for the 2011 \n",
      "guideline confirmed that ABPM is still likely to be the most cost-effective method for \n",

      "The evidence showed that validated HBPM is an accurate method of diagnosing \n",

      "there is still variation in practice. A change in practice and additional resources and \n",

      "Why the committee made the recommendations \n",
      "Although evidence on symptoms and signs of asthma was not reviewed for this guideline \n",
      "update, the committee emphasised the importance of taking a good clinical history in all \n",
      "their discussions of diagnosis. Evidence on objective tests was only included if it was \n",
      "carried out in people in whom asthma was suspected on clinical grounds. Therefore, the \n",

      "depending on the mode of presentation, other diagnoses might be considered, but they \n",
      "confined their recommendations to confirmation or exclusion of asthma. \n",
      "The committee reviewed evidence on tests of variation in airflow obstruction and markers \n",

      "specificity of the various tests but did not base their recommendations on these measures \n",

      "specificity to be diagnostic in all cases. However, some of them showed high specificity \n",
      "and were potentially useful as rule-in tests with a suitably high cut-off value. It was agreed \n",
      "that a combination of tests would be needed for most people. \n",

      "care and not readily available in secondary care), the ability of people to perform the tests, \n",
      "and the acceptability of the tests to the person, which is particularly relevant in younger \n",
