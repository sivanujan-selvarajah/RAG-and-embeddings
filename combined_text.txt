Your responsibility 
The recommendations in this guideline represent the view of NICE, arrived at after careful 
consideration of the evidence available. When exercising their judgement, professionals 
and practitioners are expected to take this guideline fully into account, alongside the 
individual needs, preferences and values of their patients or the people using their service. 
It is not mandatory to apply the recommendations, and the guideline does not override the 
responsibility to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual, in 
consultation with them and their families and carers or guardian. 
All problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment 
or in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory 
Agency using the Yellow Card Scheme. 
Local commissioners and providers of healthcare have a responsibility to enable the 
guideline to be applied when individual professionals and people using services wish to 
use it. They should do so in the context of local and national priorities for funding and 
developing services, and in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate 
unlawful discrimination, to advance equality of opportunity and to reduce health 
inequalities. Nothing in this guideline should be interpreted in a way that would be 
inconsistent with complying with those duties. 
Commissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally 
sustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental 
impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible.

This guideline replaces CG127. 
This guideline partially replaces NG28. 
This guideline is the basis of QS181, QS28 and QS209. 
Overview 
This guideline covers identifying and treating primary hypertension (high blood pressure) 
in people aged 18 and over, including people with type 2 diabetes. It aims to reduce the 
risk of cardiovascular problems such as heart attacks and strokes by helping healthcare 
professionals to diagnose hypertension accurately and treat it effectively. 
NICE has also produced a guideline on hypertension in pregnancy. 
Who is it for? 
• Healthcare professionals 
• Commissioners and providers 
• People who have or may have high blood pressure, their families and carers

Recommendations 
People have the right to be involved in discussions and make informed decisions 
about their care, as described in NICE's information on making decisions about your 
care. 
Making decisions using NICE guidelines explains how we use words to show the 
strength (or certainty) of our recommendations, and has information about 
prescribing medicines (including off-label use), professional guidelines, standards 
and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and safeguarding. 
The recommendations on measuring blood pressure and diagnosing hypertension in this 
guideline apply to all adults, including those with type 2 diabetes. The recommendations 
on treatment and monitoring link to NICE's guidelines on chronic kidney disease, type 1 
diabetes and hypertension in pregnancy at points in the care pathway where treatment 
differs. The recommendations on treatment and monitoring apply to adults with type 2 
diabetes and replace recommendations on diagnosing and managing hypertension in 
NICE's guideline on type 2 diabetes in adults. 
1.1 Measuring blood pressure 
Training, technique and device maintenance 
1.1.1 
Ensure that healthcare professionals taking blood pressure measurements have 
adequate initial training and periodic review of their performance. [2004] 
1.1.2 
Because automated devices may not measure blood pressure accurately if there 
is pulse irregularity (for example, due to atrial fibrillation), palpate the radial or 
brachial pulse before measuring blood pressure. If pulse irregularity is present, 
measure blood pressure manually using direct auscultation over the brachial 
artery. [2011] 
1.1.3 
Healthcare providers must ensure that devices for measuring blood pressure are

properly validated, maintained and regularly recalibrated according to 
manufacturers' instructions. See the British and Irish Hypertension Society's 
website for a list of validated blood pressure monitoring devices. [2004] 
1.1.4 
When measuring blood pressure in the clinic or in the home, standardise the 
environment and provide a relaxed, temperate setting, with the person quiet and 
seated, and their arm outstretched and supported. Use an appropriate cuff size 
for the person's arm. [2011, amended 2019] 
Postural hypotension 
1.1.5 
In people with symptoms of postural hypotension, including falls or postural 
dizziness: 
• measure blood pressure with the person lying on their back (or consider a 
seated position, if it is inconvenient to measure blood pressure with the 
person lying down) 
• measure blood pressure again after the person has been standing for at least 
1 minute. [2004, amended 2023] 
1.1.6 
If the person's systolic blood pressure falls by 20 mmHg or more, or their diastolic 
blood pressure falls by 10 mmHg or more, after the person has been standing for 
at least 1 minute: 
• consider likely causes, including reviewing their current medication 
• manage appropriately (for example, for advice on preventing falls in older 
people, see NICE's guideline on falls in older people: assessing risk and 
prevention) 
• measure subsequent blood pressures with the person standing 
• consider referral to specialist care if symptoms of postural hypotension 
persist despite addressing likely causes. [2004, amended 2023] 
1.1.7 
If the blood pressure drop is less than the thresholds in recommendation 1.1.6 
despite suggestive symptoms and the baseline measurement was previously

taken from a seated position, repeat the measurements this time starting with the 
person lying on their back. [2023] 
1.1.8 
Consider referring the person for further specialist assessment if blood pressure 
measurements do not confirm postural hypotension despite suggestive 
symptoms. [2023] 
1.2 Diagnosing hypertension 
1.2.1 
When considering a diagnosis of hypertension, measure blood pressure in both 
arms: 
• If the difference in readings between arms is more than 15 mmHg, repeat the 
measurements. 
• If the difference in readings between arms remains more than 15 mmHg on 
the second measurement, measure subsequent blood pressures in the arm 
with the higher reading. [2019] 
1.2.2 
If blood pressure measured in the clinic is 140/90 mmHg or higher: 
• Take a second measurement during the consultation. 
• If the second measurement is substantially different from the first, take a 
third measurement. 
Record the lower of the last 2 measurements as the clinic blood pressure. 
[2019] 
1.2.3 
If clinic blood pressure is between 140/90 mmHg and 180/120 mmHg, offer 
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) to confirm the diagnosis of 
hypertension. See the section on identifying who to refer for people with a clinic 
blood pressure 180/120 mmHg or higher. [2019] 
1.2.4 
If ABPM is unsuitable or the person is unable to tolerate it, offer home blood 
pressure monitoring (HBPM) to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension. [2019]

1.2.5 
While waiting for confirmation of a diagnosis of hypertension, carry out: 
• investigations for target organ damage (see recommendation 1.3.3), followed 
by 
• formal assessment of cardiovascular risk using a cardiovascular risk 
assessment tool (see the section on full formal risk assessment in NICE's 
guideline on cardiovascular disease). [2019] 
1.2.6 
When using ABPM to confirm a diagnosis of hypertension, ensure that at least 
2 measurements per hour are taken during the person's usual waking hours (for 
example, between 08:00 and 22:00). Use the average value of at least 
14 measurements taken during the person's usual waking hours to confirm a 
diagnosis of hypertension. [2011] 
1.2.7 
When using HBPM to confirm a diagnosis of hypertension, ensure that: 
• for each blood pressure recording, 2 consecutive measurements are taken, at 
least 1 minute apart and with the person seated and 
• blood pressure is recorded twice daily, ideally in the morning and evening 
and 
• blood pressure recording continues for at least 4 days, ideally for 7 days. 
Discard the measurements taken on the first day and use the average value 
of all the remaining measurements to confirm a diagnosis of hypertension. 
[2011] 
1.2.8 
Confirm diagnosis of hypertension in people with a: 
• clinic blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg or higher and 
• ABPM daytime average or HBPM average of 135/85 mmHg or higher. [2019] 
1.2.9 
If hypertension is not diagnosed but there is evidence of target organ damage, 
consider carrying out investigations for alternative causes of the target organ 
damage (for information on investigations, see NICE's guidelines on chronic 
kidney disease and chronic heart failure). [2011]

1.2.10 
If hypertension is not diagnosed, measure the person's clinic blood pressure at 
least every 5 years subsequently, and consider measuring it more frequently if 
the person's clinic blood pressure is close to 140/90 mmHg. [2011] 
Annual blood pressure measurement for people with type 2 
diabetes 
1.2.11 
Measure blood pressure at least annually in an adult with type 2 diabetes without 
previously diagnosed hypertension or renal disease. Offer and reinforce 
preventive lifestyle advice. [2009] 
Specialist investigations for possible secondary causes of 
hypertension 
1.2.12 
Consider the need for specialist investigations in people with signs and 
symptoms suggesting a secondary cause of hypertension. [2004, amended 
2011] 
For a short explanation of why the committee made the 2019 recommendations and 
how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on diagnosing 
hypertension. 
Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review A: 
diagnosis. 
1.3 Assessing cardiovascular risk and target organ 
damage 
For guidance on the early identification and management of chronic kidney disease, see 
NICE's guideline on chronic kidney disease. 
1.3.1 
Use a formal estimation of cardiovascular risk to discuss prognosis and

healthcare options with people with hypertension, both for raised blood pressure 
and other modifiable risk factors. [2004] 
1.3.2 
Estimate cardiovascular risk in line with the recommendations on identifying and 
assessing cardiovascular disease risk in NICE's guideline on cardiovascular 
disease. Use clinic blood pressure measurements to calculate cardiovascular risk. 
[2008] 
1.3.3 
For all people with hypertension offer to: 
• test for the presence of protein in the urine by sending a urine sample for 
estimation of the albumin:creatinine ratio and test for haematuria using a 
reagent strip 
• take a blood sample to measure glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C), electrolytes, 
creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, total cholesterol and HDL 
cholesterol 
• examine the fundi for the presence of hypertensive retinopathy 
• arrange for a 12-lead electrocardiograph to be performed. [2011, amended 
2019] 
1.4 Treating and monitoring hypertension 
Lifestyle interventions 
For guidance on the prevention of obesity and cardiovascular disease, see NICE's 
guidelines on obesity prevention and cardiovascular disease prevention. 
1.4.1 
Offer lifestyle advice to people with suspected or diagnosed hypertension, and 
continue to offer it periodically. [2004] 
1.4.2 
Ask about people's diet and exercise patterns because a healthy diet and regular 
exercise can reduce blood pressure. Offer appropriate guidance and written or 
audiovisual materials to promote lifestyle changes. [2004]

1.4.3 
Ask about people's alcohol consumption and encourage a reduced intake if they 
drink excessively, because this can reduce blood pressure and has broader 
health benefits. See the recommendations for practice in NICE's guideline on 
alcohol-use disorders. [2004, amended 2019] 
1.4.4 
Discourage excessive consumption of coffee and other caffeine-rich products. 
[2004] 
1.4.5 
Encourage people to keep their dietary sodium intake low, either by reducing or 
substituting sodium salt, as this can reduce blood pressure. Note that salt 
substitutes containing potassium chloride should not be used by older people, 
people with diabetes, pregnant women, people with kidney disease and people 
taking some antihypertensive drugs, such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II 
receptor blockers. Encourage salt reduction in these groups. [2004, amended 
2019] 
1.4.6 
Do not offer calcium, magnesium or potassium supplements as a method for 
reducing blood pressure. [2004] 
1.4.7 
Offer advice and help to smokers to stop smoking. See NICE's guideline on 
tobacco. [2004] 
1.4.8 
Inform people about local initiatives by, for example, healthcare teams or patient 
organisations that provide support and promote healthy lifestyle change, 
especially those that include group work for motivating lifestyle change. [2004] 
For a short explanation of why the committee deleted the recommendation on 
relaxation therapies and how this might affect practice, see the rationale and impact 
section on relaxation therapies. 
Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review H: 
relaxation therapies. 
Starting antihypertensive drug treatment 
NICE has produced a patient decision aid on treatment options for hypertension to help 
people and their healthcare professionals discuss the different types of treatment and

make a decision that is right for each person. 
For advice on shared decision making for medicines, see the information on patient 
decision aids in NICE's guideline on medicines optimisation. 
To support adherence and ensure that people with hypertension make the most effective 
use of their medicines, see NICE's guideline on medicines adherence. 
1.4.9 
Offer antihypertensive drug treatment in addition to lifestyle advice to adults of 
any age with persistent stage 2 hypertension. Use clinical judgement for people 
of any age with frailty or multimorbidity (see also NICE's guideline on 
multimorbidity). [2019] 
1.4.10 
Discuss starting antihypertensive drug treatment, in addition to lifestyle advice, 
with adults aged under 80 with persistent stage 1 hypertension who have 1 or 
more of the following: 
• target organ damage 
• established cardiovascular disease 
• renal disease 
• diabetes 
• an estimated 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease of 10% or more. 
Use clinical judgement for people with frailty or multimorbidity (see also 
NICE's guideline on multimorbidity). [2019] 
1.4.11 
Discuss with the person their individual cardiovascular disease risk and their 
preferences for treatment, including no treatment, and explain the risks and 
benefits before starting antihypertensive drug treatment. Continue to offer 
lifestyle advice and support them to make lifestyle changes (see the section on 
lifestyle interventions), whether or not they choose to start antihypertensive drug 
treatment. [2019] 
1.4.12 
Consider antihypertensive drug treatment in addition to lifestyle advice for adults 
aged under 60 with stage 1 hypertension and an estimated 10-year risk below 
Hypertension in adults: diagnosis and management (NG136)

10%. Bear in mind that 10-year cardiovascular risk may underestimate the lifetime 
probability of developing cardiovascular disease. [2019] 
1.4.13 
Consider antihypertensive drug treatment in addition to lifestyle advice for 
people aged over 80 with stage 1 hypertension if their clinic blood pressure is 
over 150/90 mmHg. Use clinical judgement for people with frailty or 
multimorbidity (see also NICE's guideline on multimorbidity). [2019] 
1.4.14 
For adults aged under 40 with hypertension, consider seeking specialist 
evaluation of secondary causes of hypertension and a more detailed assessment 
of the long-term balance of treatment benefit and risks. [2019] 
For a short explanation of why the committee made the 2019 recommendations and 
how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on starting 
antihypertensive drug treatment. 
Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review C: 
initiating treatment. 
Monitoring treatment and blood pressure targets 
For specific recommendations on blood pressure control in people with other conditions or 
who are pregnant, see NICE's guidelines on chronic kidney disease, type 1 diabetes and 
hypertension in pregnancy. 
See also table 1 for clinic blood pressure targets for people aged under 80 and table 2 for 
clinic blood pressure targets for people aged 80 and over. The tables cover people with 
hypertension (with or without type 2 diabetes) as well as people with chronic kidney 
disease or type 1 diabetes.

Use clinic blood pressure measurements to monitor the response to lifestyle 
changes or drug treatment in people with hypertension. [2019] 
1.4.16 
Check for postural hypotension (see recommendation 1.1.5) in people with 
hypertension and: 
• type 2 diabetes or 
• symptoms of postural hypotension (see also recommendation 1.1.7) or 
• aged 80 and over. 
In people with a significant postural drop or symptoms of postural 
hypotension, treat to a blood pressure target based on standing blood 
pressure. [2019, amended 2023] 
1.4.17 
Advise people with hypertension who choose to self-monitor their blood pressure 
to use HBPM. (NHS England is supporting the use of HBPM through the blood 
pressure@home scheme.) [2019] 
1.4.18 
Consider ABPM or HBPM, in addition to clinic blood pressure measurements, for 
people with hypertension identified as having a white-coat effect or masked 
hypertension (in which clinic and non-clinic blood pressure results are 
conflicting). Be aware that the corresponding measurements for ABPM and HBPM 
are 5 mmHg lower than for clinic measurements (see recommendation 1.2.8 for 
diagnostic thresholds). [2019] 
1.4.19 
For people who choose to use HBPM, provide: 
• training and advice on using home blood pressure monitors 
• information about what to do if they are not achieving their target blood 
pressure.

Be aware that the corresponding measurements for HBPM are 5 mmHg lower 
than for clinic measurements (see recommendation 1.2.8 for diagnostic 
thresholds). [2019] 
1.4.20 
For adults with hypertension aged under 80, reduce clinic blood pressure to 
below 140/90 mmHg and ensure that it is maintained below that level. See also 
table 1 for guidance on clinic blood pressure targets for people aged under 80 
with type 1 diabetes or severe chronic kidney disease. [2019, amended 2022] 
1.4.21 
For adults with hypertension aged 80 and over, reduce clinic blood pressure to 
below 150/90 mmHg and ensure that it is maintained below that level. Use clinical 
judgement for people with frailty or multimorbidity (see NICE's guideline on 
multimorbidity). See also table 2 for guidance on clinic blood pressure targets for 
people aged 80 and over with type 1 diabetes or severe chronic kidney disease. 
[2019, amended 2022] 
1.4.22 
When using ABPM or HBPM to monitor the response to treatment in adults with 
hypertension, use the average blood pressure level taken during the person's 
usual waking hours (see recommendations 1.2.6 and 1.2.7). Reduce blood 
pressure and ensure that it is maintained: 
• below 135/85 mmHg for adults aged under 80 
• below 145/85 mmHg for adults aged 80 and over. 
Use clinical judgement for people with frailty or multimorbidity (see also 
NICE's guideline on multimorbidity). [2019, amended 2022] 
For a short explanation of why the committee made the 2019 recommendations and 
how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on monitoring 
treatment and blood pressure targets for people without cardiovascular disease.

For a short explanation of why the committee made the recommendation on blood 
pressure targets for people with cardiovascular disease and how this might affect 
practice, see the rationale and impact section on monitoring treatment and blood 
pressure targets for people with cardiovascular disease. 
Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in the evidence review 
J: blood pressure targets. 
1.4.24 
Provide an annual review of care for adults with hypertension to monitor blood 
pressure, provide people with support, and discuss their lifestyle, symptoms and 
medication. [2004] 
Treatment review when type 2 diabetes is diagnosed 
1.4.25 
For an adult with type 2 diabetes on antihypertensive drug treatment when 
diabetes is diagnosed, review blood pressure control and medications used. 
Make changes only if there is poor control or if current drug treatment is not 
appropriate because of microvascular complications or metabolic problems. 
[2009] 
Choosing antihypertensive drug treatment (for people with or 
without type 2 diabetes) 
The recommendations in this section apply to people with hypertension with or without 
type 2 diabetes. They replace the recommendations on diagnosing and managing 
hypertension in NICE's guideline on type 2 diabetes in adults. For guidance on choosing 
antihypertensive drug treatment in people with type 1 diabetes, see also the section on 
control of cardiovascular risk in NICE's guideline on type 1 diabetes.

Note that ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists should not be used in 
pregnant or breastfeeding women or women planning pregnancy unless absolutely 
necessary, in which case the potential risks and benefits should be discussed. Follow 
the MHRA safety advice on ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists: not 
for use in pregnancy, recommendations on how to use for breastfeeding and the 
related clarification on breastfeeding. 
1.4.26 
For guidance on choice of antihypertensive medicine in people with chronic 
kidney disease, see NICE's guideline on chronic kidney disease. If possible, offer 
treatment with drugs taken only once a day. [2004] 
1.4.27 
Prescribe non-proprietary drugs if these are appropriate and minimise cost.

1.5 Identifying who to refer for same-day specialist 
review 
1.5.1 
If a person has severe hypertension (clinic blood pressure of 180/120 mmHg or 
higher), but no symptoms or signs indicating same-day referral (see 
recommendation 1.5.2), carry out investigations for target organ damage (see 
recommendation 1.3.3) as soon as possible: 
• If target organ damage is identified, consider starting antihypertensive drug 
treatment immediately, without waiting for the results of ABPM or HBPM. 
• If no target organ damage is identified, confirm diagnosis by: 
－ repeating clinic blood pressure measurement within 7 days, or 
－ considering monitoring using ABPM (or HBPM if ABPM is not suitable or 
not tolerated), following recommendations 1.2.6 and 1.2.7, and ensuring a 
clinical review within 7 days. [2019] 
1.5.2 
Refer people for specialist assessment, carried out on the same day, if they have 
a clinic blood pressure of 180/120 mmHg and higher with: 
• signs of retinal haemorrhage or papilloedema (accelerated hypertension) or 
• life-threatening symptoms such as new onset confusion, chest pain, signs of 
heart failure, or acute kidney injury. [2019] 
1.5.3 
Refer people for specialist assessment, carried out on the same day, if they have 
suspected phaeochromocytoma (for example, labile or postural hypotension, 
headache, palpitations, pallor, abdominal pain or diaphoresis). [2019] 
For a short explanation of why the committee made the 2019 recommendations and 
how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on identifying 
who to refer for same-day specialist review.

Terms used in this guideline 
This section defines terms that have been used in a particular way for this guideline. For 
other definitions see the NICE glossary. 
Accelerated hypertension 
A severe increase in blood pressure to 180/120 mmHg or higher (and often over 220/
120 mmHg) with signs of retinal haemorrhage and/or papilloedema (swelling of the optic 
nerve). It is usually associated with new or progressive target organ damage and is also 
known as malignant hypertension. 
Established cardiovascular disease 
Medical history of ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular 
disease, aortic aneurysm or heart failure. Cardiovascular disease is a general term for 
conditions affecting the heart or blood vessels. It is usually associated with a build-up of 
fatty deposits inside the arteries (atherosclerosis) and an increased risk of blood clots. It 
can also be associated with damage to arteries in organs such as the brain, heart, kidneys 
and eyes through deposition of glassy material within the artery walls (arteriosclerosis). 
Cardiovascular disease is 1 of the main causes of death and disability in the UK, but it can 
often largely be prevented by leading a healthy lifestyle. 
Masked hypertension 
Clinic blood pressure measurements are normal (less than 140/90 mmHg), but blood 
pressure measurements are higher when taken outside the clinic using average daytime 
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) or average home blood pressure monitoring 
(HBPM) blood pressure measurements. 
Persistent hypertension 
High blood pressure at repeated clinical encounters. 
Stage 1 hypertension 
Clinic blood pressure ranging from 140/90 mmHg to 159/99 mmHg and subsequent ABPM

daytime average or HBPM average blood pressure ranging from 135/85 mmHg to 149/
94 mmHg. 
Stage 2 hypertension 
Clinic blood pressure of 160/100 mmHg or higher but less than 180/120 mmHg and 
subsequent ABPM daytime average or HBPM average blood pressure of 150/95 mmHg or 
higher. 
Stage 3 or severe hypertension 
Clinic systolic blood pressure of 180 mmHg or higher or clinic diastolic blood pressure of 
120 mmHg or higher. 
Target organ damage 
Damage to organs such as the heart, brain, kidneys and eyes. Examples are left ventricular 
hypertrophy, chronic kidney disease, hypertensive retinopathy or increased urine 
albumin:creatinine ratio. 
White-coat effect 
A discrepancy of more than 20/10 mmHg between clinic and average daytime ABPM or 
average HBPM blood pressure measurements at the time of diagnosis.

Rationale and impact 
These sections briefly explain why the committee made the recommendations and how 
they might affect practice. They link to details of the evidence and a full description of the 
committee's discussion. 
Diagnosing hypertension 
Recommendations 1.2.1 to 1.2.5 and 1.2.8 
Why the committee made the recommendations 
Overall, there was limited new evidence on the accuracy of different methods of 
measuring blood pressure. Most of the studies identified were small, and the populations 
and protocols for measurement varied making interpretation difficult. However, the 
committee agreed that it was important to focus on the evidence from these more recent 
studies (post-2000) because the evidence should reflect the current use of electronic 
sphygmomanometers, which have replaced mercury-based sphygmomanometers. 
The evidence did not show that changing the current blood pressure thresholds for clinic 
measurement or home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) would improve diagnostic 
accuracy compared with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), so the committee 
agreed the 2011 thresholds for diagnosis should be retained. The committee noted that 
these are in line with most international guidance. 
Limited evidence suggested that clinic blood pressure measurement is less accurate than 
HBPM or ABPM when used to diagnose hypertension. The committee members 
acknowledged that these findings were in line with their clinical experience and agreed 
that clinic blood pressure measurement alone would not be an adequate method to 
diagnose hypertension. 
The committee discussed repeat clinic blood pressure measurements when there is a 
difference in blood pressure between arms and noted that clinical practice varied. Based 
on their experience and knowledge, the committee members agreed that a cut-off of 
15 mmHg would be more suitable than 20 mmHg, which was specified in the 2011 
recommendations. This is in line with recent evidence that suggests a small difference in 
Hypertension in adults: diagnosis and management (NG136)

conditions#notice-of-rights).

52

arm blood pressure is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, possibly 
due to vascular damage. 
ABPM correlates well with invasive blood pressure measurement and can identify both 
white-coat and masked hypertension. Based on the evidence in the 2011 guideline and the 
committee's experience and knowledge, it was agreed that ABPM remains the gold 
standard for the accurate measurement of blood pressure in primary care. ABPM has 
therefore been retained as the preferred method for the diagnosis of hypertension. In 
addition, economic evidence obtained by updating the health economic model for the 2011 
guideline confirmed that ABPM is still likely to be the most cost-effective method for 
diagnosis, even with the inclusion of new data for improved accuracy of home and clinic 
measurement. 
The evidence showed that validated HBPM is an accurate method of diagnosing 
hypertension for people in sinus rhythm. The committee's experience in clinical practice 
supported this, and the committee agreed that it is a suitable alternative when ABPM is 
unsuitable or not tolerated. The committee noted that the British and Irish Hypertension 
Society maintains a list of validated blood pressure devices for home use. The British and 
Irish Hypertension Society is an independent reviewer of published work and this does not 
imply any endorsement of specific devices by NICE. 
The evidence did not suggest that there were any benefits of adding telemonitoring to 
HBPM. Therefore, the committee agreed that it could not make a recommendation on 
telemonitoring for the diagnosis of hypertension. 
How the recommendations might affect practice 
The recommendations reinforce current good practice. However, the committee noted that 
implementation of the 2011 recommendations on ABPM has been challenging and that 
there is still variation in practice. A change in practice and additional resources and 
training will be needed in areas where there is currently no access to ABPM devices. 
However, ABPM was found to be the most cost-effective method of diagnosis, and it is 
anticipated that the long-term benefits of accurate diagnosis and treatment (such as 
avoiding over diagnosis and unnecessary treatment) will outweigh any initial costs.

Relaxation therapies 
Why the committee deleted the recommendation on relaxation 
therapies 
The evidence on relaxation therapies was limited to a single small study. The study 
suggested some benefit in reducing angina and myocardial infarction, but it also 
suggested an increase in stroke. The committee agreed that the study was not adequate 
to assess the effectiveness of these therapies or to make a recommendation. 
The 2011 guideline stated that relaxation therapies could reduce blood pressure, but it did 
not recommend their routine use in practice. The committee noted that this was based on 
evidence for reducing blood pressure only, and there was no evidence of a direct benefit 
to people with hypertension, such as improving quality of life or reducing cardiovascular 
events. The committee agreed there was insufficient evidence of benefit to recommend 
that people pursue this option themselves and agreed to remove this recommendation. It 
is not the intention of the committee to stop people from trying relaxation therapies if they 
wish to, but to make people aware that there is less evidence for benefit of this 
intervention compared with other lifestyle interventions or pharmacological treatment. The 
committee agreed that the clinical focus for non-pharmacological treatment of 
hypertension should be on encouraging people to make lifestyle changes, such as taking 
regular exercise and maintaining a healthy weight. 
The committee agreed that further research would be useful to determine whether 
relaxation therapies are a clinically effective treatment for hypertension in terms of 
reducing cardiovascular events or improving quality of life (see the recommendation for 
research on relaxation therapies). They also noted that a larger study would be needed to 
obtain meaningful results. 
How this might affect practice 
Relaxation therapies were not recommended for routine use in the 2011 guideline, and they 
are not used in current practice for the management of primary hypertension in adults. The 
2011 recommendation advised that people may try them as part of their treatment to 
reduce blood pressure, but committee consensus was that uptake has been low. 
Therefore, current practice will not be affected by the removal of the 2011 
recommendation.

Starting antihypertensive drug treatment 
Recommendations 1.4.9 to 1.4.14 
Why the committee made the recommendations 
The evidence suggested that antihypertensive drug treatment was effective at reducing 
cardiovascular events in people with a clinic blood pressure of 160/100 mmHg or more 
(stage 2 hypertension). 
A large study also suggested there was benefit of treating people with stage 1 
hypertension. However, other studies in people with a low cardiovascular risk did not 
identify a benefit of treatment, and the committee agreed that the benefit of treatment 
across different cardiovascular risk groups was uncertain. The evidence was used to 
develop an economic model to compare the cost effectiveness of antihypertensive 
treatment with no treatment in people with stage 1 hypertension at different levels of 
cardiovascular risk. For people aged 60, the model showed that treatment was cost 
effective at a 10-year cardiovascular risk level of 10%, but there was some uncertainty at 
around 5% risk. Further analysis showed that it was cost effective to offer antihypertensive 
treatment to people aged 40 and 50 with stage 1 hypertension at a 5% risk and 
aged 70 and 75 at a 10% or 15% risk. QRISK was specified as the risk tool because it is 
recommended by NICE for risk calculation and most likely to be used in practice. 
Taking into account the evidence and the results of the model, the committee were 
confident that people under 80 with stage 1 hypertension and a cardiovascular risk above 
10% should have a discussion with their healthcare professional about starting 
antihypertensive treatment, alongside lifestyle changes, and that this would be a clinically 
and cost-effective use of NHS resources. The committee also agreed that 
antihypertensive treatment should be considered for people under 60 with a risk below 
10%, with the degree of uncertainty in treating people at low risk reflected in the strength 
of the recommendation. 
The committee members were mindful of the additional population that would be affected 
by lowering the threshold and were aware that the decision to start drug treatment would 
depend on the person's preferences and their individual risk of cardiovascular disease. 
The recommendations highlight the importance of discussing the person's preferences for 
treatment and encouraging lifestyle changes.

Some studies investigated the benefits of treating hypertension in people with lower 
cardiovascular risk or people with blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg. However, some of 
these studies were not directly relevant because they included a high proportion of 
participants with chronic kidney disease and previous cardiovascular events. For this 
reason, several studies could not be used to inform the recommendations. For details of 
these studies see evidence review C: initiating treatment. 
The committee discussed the lack of evidence to inform a threshold for starting treatment 
in people aged under 40. It was agreed that this is an important area for future research 
and the recommendation for research was carried forward from the 2011 guideline (see 
the recommendation for research on thresholds for interventions in adults aged under 40). 
The committee agreed that there was no evidence to suggest that thresholds for starting 
treatment should be different in people with type 2 diabetes. The previous 
recommendations for people with type 2 diabetes (in NICE's guideline on type 2 diabetes 
in adults) suggested starting antihypertensive drug treatment if lifestyle interventions 
alone did not reduce blood pressure to below 140/80 mmHg or 130/80 mmHg in the 
presence of kidney, cerebrovascular or eye disease. However, this was based on evidence 
from 2 small studies in which the participants did not have hypertension. Further evidence 
for lower treatment thresholds in people with type 2 diabetes was limited within this 
review, with the committee aware of some evidence to suggest that lower blood pressure 
thresholds did not reduce the rate of cardiovascular events in people without additional 
risk factors. The committee therefore agreed that there was insufficient evidence to 
recommend a different threshold for starting treatment for this subgroup. 
There was no evidence identified on thresholds for people aged over 80, and no prior 
recommendation for this age group with hypertension below stage 2; therefore, the 
committee agreed that the threshold for starting treatment in people aged over 80 should 
be consistent with the target for treatment in this population (150/90 mmHg or lower). 
The committee discussed the additional risks of starting treatment in older people, 
particularly those who are frail or have multiple comorbidities. Based on their expertise 
and experience, they agreed that the use of clinical judgement should be highlighted in 
decision making for people with frailty or multimorbidity, and that it should apply to people 
of any age. The committee agreed that a number of factors should be considered when 
discussing treatment options in this group and noted that healthcare professionals should 
refer to NICE's guideline on multimorbidity for further advice.

How the recommendations might affect practice 
The recommendations will have a significant impact on practice because more people will 
now be eligible for treatment. It is difficult to predict the extent of the impact because 
there is variability in how the 2011 recommendation with a threshold of 20% is being 
implemented in practice. However, it is believed, based on some recently published UK 
data, that potentially around 50% of people with stage 1 hypertension and risk below 20% 
are already being treated with antihypertensive drugs (Association of guideline and policy 
changes with incidence of lifestyle advice and treatment for uncomplicated mild 
hypertension in primary care. Sheppard et al. 2018). 
People with stage 1 hypertension should already be monitored every year, but reducing 
the threshold will increase the number of people being prescribed antihypertensive drugs 
and increase staff time and consultations involved in starting and monitoring their drug 
treatment. However, there will be a reduction in cardiovascular events resulting in savings, 
although it is acknowledged that the costs and savings may fall in different sectors of the 
NHS.

Monitoring treatment and blood pressure targets 
Recommendations 1.4.15 to 1.4.22 
Monitoring treatment 
Why the committee made the recommendations 
The committee agreed that there was not enough evidence to strongly recommend home 
blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) for monitoring treatment in adults with hypertension. 
The evidence on monitoring was limited, with relatively small studies comparing different 
combinations of HBPM (with or without telemonitoring and with or without pharmacist 
input), pharmacy monitoring and clinic monitoring. It suggested that people had improved 
blood pressure control with HBPM with telemonitoring, with or without pharmacy input, 
compared with clinic monitoring, and the greatest blood pressure reduction was achieved 
with pharmacist input. However, the evidence was insufficient for the committee to make a 
recommendation.

The committee decided to retain the 2011 recommendation on using clinic blood pressure, 
but also agreed that the updated guideline should support home monitoring for people 
who wish to use it. The committee discussed the importance of patient choice and agreed 
that home monitoring should be an option, if it is suitable and the person is willing and 
motivated to use it. HBPM is already widely used in practice, especially for people with a 
white-coat effect. The committee agreed this would be reflected in the recommendation 
supported by the evidence and consensus opinion. Based on their experience, the 
committee agreed that training and advice would be needed for people using HBPM to 
ensure that people take measurements correctly and know when to contact their 
healthcare professional if they are not achieving their target blood pressure. 
The 2011 guideline included a recommendation for further research for the best method of 
monitoring hypertension in people with atrial fibrillation. No evidence was identified in the 
updated reviews to inform recommendations for this group and therefore the committee 
agreed that this recommendation for research should be retained to inform future updates 
of the guideline (see the recommendation for research on automated blood pressure 
monitoring). 
The committee agreed they could not make a recommendation on telemonitoring because 
the evidence was not sufficient to show a clear benefit and the studies were inconsistent 
in the telemonitoring methods used. 
How the recommendations might affect practice 
The recommendations reflect current practice, so there should be no change in practice. 
They will encourage appropriate and suitable training to be given so that both people with 
hypertension and their healthcare professionals are confident that blood pressure is being 
measured properly using home monitoring devices.

Blood pressure targets for people without cardiovascular disease 
Recommendations 1.4.15 to 1.4.22 
Why the committee made the recommendations 
No evidence was identified to determine whether cardiovascular risk or blood pressure

52

targets should be used. The committee agreed that in the absence of evidence the focus 
should be on blood pressure targets, based on their expertise and experience of current 
practice. 
The evidence for blood pressure targets showed that there were both benefits and harms 
associated with a lower clinic systolic blood pressure target of 120 mmHg compared with 
140 mmHg in people with primary hypertension without type 2 diabetes. Although the 
evidence suggested some benefit in reducing mortality and cardiovascular events, the 
lower blood pressure target was associated with a greater risk of harms, such as injury 
from falls and acute kidney injury. The committee agreed that the long-term implications of 
these adverse events were unclear and that further research is needed. 
This evidence came from the SPRINT trial, which was a large study undertaken in the US. 
The committee discussed concerns about the population included in the study and the 
applicability to UK practice of the methods used. The study used automated blood 
pressure devices with a time delay and an isolated rest period, which is not common 
practice in the UK. The committee considered that the use of these devices would lead to 
lower blood pressure readings than in routine UK clinical practice. They also had concerns 
that some medicines were stopped when blood pressure targets were achieved, which 
may have had an impact on the results. The committee also discussed concerns about 
applicability of the population; for example, the participants had high cardiovascular risk 
levels, including many with pre-existing cardiovascular disease or renal impairment, and 
were already receiving treatment before the study started. These concerns made the 
evidence difficult to interpret and use to inform the recommendations. Further details of 
the committee's discussion of this study is included in evidence review D: targets. 
Evidence from a smaller study also showed some benefit of lowering clinic systolic blood 
pressure targets to 130 mmHg. However, the committee noted that the study was based 
on people already receiving treatment and that it lacked information on adverse events. 
The committee agreed that there was no evidence to suggest that blood pressure targets 
should be different in people with type 2 diabetes. Evidence for lower targets in people 
with type 2 diabetes was also limited, with some evidence to suggest that lower blood 
pressure targets did not reduce the rate of cardiovascular events. Previous 
recommendations for people with type 2 diabetes (in NICE's guideline on type 2 diabetes 
in adults) suggested a blood pressure target below 130/80 mmHg in the presence of 
target organ damage such as kidney, cerebrovascular or eye disease. The committee 
noted that the evidence behind this recommendation was based on 2 small studies in 
Hypertension in adults: diagnosis and management (NG136)

conditions#notice-of-rights).

52

people without hypertension. They also had concerns about the relevance of the study 
design. The committee were also aware of trial data showing less benefit in populations 
with type 2 diabetes with fewer additional risk factors. The committee therefore agreed 
that there was insufficient evidence to recommend a different blood pressure target for 
this subgroup. It was noted that people with later-stage chronic kidney disease are 
covered by other NICE guidelines. 
Overall, the committee agreed that the evidence was unclear and insufficient to determine 
whether a lower target would be beneficial and whether it would outweigh the associated 
harms. Therefore, the 2011 clinic blood pressure target of 140/90 mmHg for adults under 
80 years was retained and applies to people with or without type 2 diabetes. The 
corresponding HBPM and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) targets were also 
retained at 135/85 mmHg. The recommendations emphasise the importance of achieving 
and maintaining a level consistently below the person's blood pressure target, whether 
this target be based on clinic blood pressure, HBPM or ABPM. 
Based on their experience, the committee members felt that people with postural 
hypotension are at risk of adverse events if a sitting or lying blood pressure is used for 
monitoring, because this measurement would overestimate daytime blood pressure and 
result in overtreatment. For example, a patient with a sitting systolic blood pressure of 
140 mmHg might have a much lower blood pressure when standing and be at an increased 
risk of falls if treated based on their sitting blood pressure. The committee decided to 
recommend that 3 groups who are at risk of postural hypotension (people over 80 years, 
with type 2 diabetes and with symptoms of postural hypotension) should have their 
standing blood pressure measured, and their treatment modified accordingly if they have 
postural hypotension. The standing blood pressure should be used for future monitoring. 
How the recommendations might affect practice 
The recommendations should reinforce current good practice. However, the new 
recommendations place more emphasis on maintaining blood pressure consistently below 
the blood pressure targets. As a result, this could lead to a higher use of antihypertensive 
drugs and an increase in consultations to maintain target blood pressure. For people with 
type 2 diabetes and target organ damage (not covered by other guidelines), the slightly 
higher target blood pressure compared to that recommended previously may reduce 
adverse events and may lead to fewer appointments and reduced drug use.

Blood pressure targets for people with cardiovascular disease 
Recommendation 1.4.23 
Why the committee made the recommendation 
The evidence did not show a robust or consistent clinical benefit from using lower blood 
pressure targets for people with cardiovascular disease compared with standard blood 
pressure targets. 
The vast majority of people in the control arms of the studies achieved blood pressures 
well below 140/90 mmHg. In the committee's experience of practice, some people with 
hypertension can have their blood pressure maintained at 140/90 mmHg, rather than 
below this level. To address this issue, the committee amended the 2019 
recommendations on blood pressure targets to emphasise the importance of reducing and 
maintaining blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg. 
The committee made recommendations for research for: 
• People aged over 80, because there was no evidence specifically for this group. The 
only evidence was from mixed age groups, and the committee agreed that this 
evidence was too limited to support a new practice recommendation. 
• People with aortic aneurysm, because there was no evidence for this group. 
• People who have had a stroke, because there was limited evidence that lower blood 
pressure targets reduced the risk of future strokes, but there was also evidence on the 
possible harms of lower targets. Evidence for both potential benefit and harm was too 
limited to inform a recommendation. 
How the recommendations might affect practice 
The new recommendation reflects current practice for most types of cardiovascular 
disease, so there should be no change in practice or increase in resource use. 
The Royal College of Physicians Intercollegiate Stroke Working Party guideline 
recommends a lower blood pressure target for people after stroke. However, the national 
quality indicators used in primary care do not use a lower blood pressure target for people 
with cardiovascular disease (including stroke and transient ischaemic attack).

Return to recommendation 
Choosing antihypertensive drug treatment for 
people with cardiovascular disease 
Recommendation 1.4.31 
Why the committee made the recommendation 
New evidence in this area was not reviewed as part of the 2022 update. Instead, the 
evidence from previous versions of the guideline was reassessed to look at outcomes for 
people with cardiovascular disease. Only evidence up to 2010 was re-analysed, because 
the 2019 update did not review evidence for people with cardiovascular disease. 
There was no difference in clinically relevant outcomes between people with and without 
cardiovascular disease. 
Evidence was limited for people with stroke, transient ischaemic attack, or coronary artery 
disease. This evidence did not cover enough treatment comparisons to allow the 
committee to draw any firm conclusions. 
There are NICE guidelines on acute coronary syndromes and chronic heart failure, and 
these guidelines make recommendations on drug treatment that overlap with treatment for 
hypertension. To avoid confusion over the treatment pathway, the committee highlighted 
that these condition-specific recommendations should be applied first (for example, when 
prescribing an ACE inhibitor or an ARB for secondary prevention of myocardial infarction). 
How the recommendations might affect practice 
The recommendation reflects current practice for most types of cardiovascular disease. 
The committee were aware that, after a stroke, the thiazide-like diuretic indapamide is 
sometimes used first, rather than a calcium channel blocker. However, it is unclear how 
common this is. As people with cardiovascular disease are commonly prescribed more 
than 1 antihypertensive drug, any impact on prescribing would be limited.

Step 1 treatment 
Recommendations 1.4.32 to 1.4.39 
Why the committee made the recommendations 
The committee reviewed the evidence for starting treatment for primary hypertension with 
a single antihypertensive medicine compared with starting with 2 antihypertensive 
medicines at once (dual therapy). Additionally, the committee reviewed the evidence on 
whether specific subgroups of people with hypertension might benefit from starting on 
dual therapy, for example people with type 2 diabetes, older people, or those of particular 
family origins. 
Some limited evidence from a single study showed that initial dual therapy may reduce 
cardiovascular events in people with hypertension and type 2 diabetes, but the committee 
members were disappointed that more comprehensive data was not available. The 
committee discussed the benefits of optimising treatment for hypertension early and 
agreed that this can substantially improve quality of life. However, there was not enough 
evidence to determine confidently the benefits or harms of starting treatment with dual 
therapy. In response to the lack of available evidence, the committee developed a 
recommendation for research on step 1 treatment to determine if particular subgroups 
would benefit from starting dual therapy, to inform future guidance. 
In the absence of compelling new evidence on step 1 dual therapy, the committee agreed 
that the previous recommendations for step 1 treatment should be retained (with minor 
changes for clarity), because they were based on robust clinical and cost-effectiveness 
evidence. One exception to this was the 2006 recommendation for considering beta-
blockers in certain groups of younger people. The committee discussed this 
recommendation and agreed that beta-blockers are rarely used as step 1 antihypertensive 
treatment in current practice and there is no established relationship between beta-
blocker use in primary hypertension and a reduction in cardiovascular events. For these 
reasons, the committee decided that the recommendation should not be retained. The 
committee noted that this is consistent with most international guidelines. 
This guideline also updates and replaces the section on blood pressure management from 
NICE's guideline on type 2 diabetes in adults. That guideline recommended that adults 
with type 2 diabetes of any age should start on an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitor as step 1 treatment (except women with a possibility of becoming pregnant and

people of Black African or African–Caribbean family origin). The committee discussed the 
evidence for this and agreed that it was sufficient to support and retain this 
recommendation. The committee agreed it should be broadened to include the choice of 
an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB; also referred to as A-type 
drugs), because they are now cost equivalent, and the committee also agreed they are 
clinically equivalent. 
For people of Black African or African–Caribbean family origin with type 2 diabetes, the 
previous recommendation was to offer step 1 dual therapy with an ACE inhibitor and either 
a diuretic (D-type drug) or a calcium channel blocker (CCB; C-type drug). However, these 
recommendations were based on monotherapy studies and when the committee looked at 
this evidence alongside the new dual therapy evidence review, they concluded that it was 
insufficient to recommend starting dual therapy in any subgroup of people with type 2 
diabetes. The committee noted that people with type 2 diabetes who are older or are of 
Black African or African–Caribbean family origin may not achieve their target blood 
pressure on ACE inhibitor or ARB monotherapy and may need to start step 2 drug therapy 
in the short term. 
How the recommendations might affect practice 
Overall, the recommendations for step 1 treatment reflect current practice for people who 
do not have type 2 diabetes. For people of Black African or African–Caribbean family origin 
who have type 2 diabetes, the recommendation to start antihypertensive monotherapy 
rather than dual therapy may result in an extra clinical appointment if the dose needs to be 
adjusted. However, it may also reduce potential harms from initial overtreatment of blood 
pressure. 
Return to recommendations 
Step 2 and 3 treatment 
Recommendations 1.4.40 to 1.4.45 
Why the committee made the recommendations 
No evidence for step 2 or step 3 treatment was identified that was relevant to determining 
the best sequence for step 2 and step 3 antihypertensive treatment. Some of the studies

available on drug treatments for hypertension were not included in this review because 
they were designed to inform step 1 treatment. Others did not reflect UK clinical practice. 
For details of these studies see evidence review F: step 2 and step 3 treatment. 
Based on evidence from the previous version of the guideline and their clinical expertise, 
the committee members agreed to retain the same choice of drugs from the 2011 
guideline, which reflect current best practice. The committee agreed that, in the absence 
of evidence of which treatment(s) are most effective for step 2 or step 3, the 
recommendation should be to offer any of these treatments based on an individualised 
approach informed by risks and benefits of each treatment and the person with 
hypertension's preference. 
The committee noted that the changes to the step 1 recommendations for some people 
with type 2 diabetes do not necessitate a change in the step 2 recommendations since the 
same options for combination treatment at step 2 are available. 
The committee agreed that the choice of drug should be discussed and agreed with the 
person, based on the person's step 1 treatment, the risks and benefits of each treatment 
option, and taking into account the person's preferences and other clinical factors. The 
updated recommendations reflect this, giving the choice of possible treatment options. A 
NICE patient decision aid on treatment choices for high blood pressure has been 
developed to support healthcare professionals and people with hypertension to discuss 
their treatment options and make informed decisions. 
How the recommendations might affect practice 
The recommendations are unlikely to alter current practice. The options for drug treatment 
remain the same and most step 2 or 3 treatment decisions are already based on an 
individualised approach.

Step 4 treatment 
Recommendations 1.4.46 to 1.4.52

52

Why the committee made the recommendations 
No evidence on step 4 treatment was identified that could be used to formulate new 
recommendations. However, the committee reviewed the 2011 recommendations and 
agreed that they should be retained and updated to reflect current best practice. 
The committee discussed the importance of confirming resistant hypertension before 
starting step 4 treatment. Based on their clinical experience and knowledge of best 
current practice, the committee members agreed that a recommendation to highlight this 
would help prevent overtreatment and ensure that people receive the right care. 
Despite the lack of evidence formally reviewed, the committee discussed the 
recommendation based on their clinical experience, taking the 2011 recommendations into 
account. The committee agreed that although the evidence for spironolactone did not 
meet the criteria for inclusion in the updated review for the guideline because the key 
study had a very short follow up and did not report any of the cardiovascular outcomes 
specified in this review protocol, the use of an aldosterone antagonist is now common 
clinical practice. Therefore, there was no reason to suggest that this recommendation 
should be changed. 
In the 2011 guideline, high-dose thiazide diuretics were recommended as a potential 
step 4 treatment in people with high blood potassium levels. The committee felt that there 
was a lack of evidence for this approach and noted that the studies did not show an 
improvement in cardiovascular outcomes at higher doses, albeit in people without resistant 
hypertension. The committee agreed that the recommendation for considering alpha- or 
beta-blockers should be retained based on significant clinical experience of their safe and 
effective use and because adding a further drug is likely to have a greater effect on blood 
pressure than increasing the thiazide diuretic dose. 
How the recommendations might affect practice 
The recommendations represent current good practice and so should not change practice. 
High-dose thiazide diuretics are not commonly used as step 4 therapy and so removing 
this should not change practice. 
There might be a small reduction in step 4 treatment with more thorough checks to 
confirm resistant hypertension. However, this may also result in an increase in blood 
pressure measurements to appropriately confirm resistant hypertension where this is not

already being done. 
Return to recommendations 
Identifying who to refer for same-day specialist 
review 
Recommendations 1.5.1 to 1.5.3 
Why the committee made the recommendations 
There was no evidence identified to inform recommendations on this topic. The committee 
reviewed the 2011 recommendations and agreed that they should be updated by 
consensus based on their clinical expertise. In particular they agreed it would be helpful to 
clarify which features warranted same-day referral, which would need further investigation 
and when repeat blood pressure measurement should be taken. 
The committee noted that it can be difficult to differentiate between accelerated 
hypertension and severe hypertension. They discussed the advantages and 
disadvantages of broader criteria for same-day referral, which would increase referrals to 
hospital but reduce the risk of missing people who need urgent treatment. The committee 
decided it would be beneficial to add some emergency symptoms to the existing 
recommendation, which will help healthcare professionals to decide when to refer. 
Based on their experience, the committee members agreed that some people with severe 
hypertension could be receiving unnecessary treatment because the 2011 guideline 
recommended treatment based on severe hypertension alone. The committee agreed that 
this could be prevented if investigations for target organ damage were carried out quickly 
before offering treatment in people with severely raised blood pressure and no other 
symptoms of concern. The committee also agreed that checking blood pressure again 
within 7 days in people with no target organ damage would ensure that people with severe 
hypertension are followed up and offered suitable treatment. 
The committee agreed that further research is needed in this area, particularly for people 
with extreme hypertension (220/120 mmHg or higher) or emergency symptoms. The 
committee members developed a recommendation for research on same-day hospital 
specialist assessment to help inform future recommendations.

How the recommendations might affect practice 
The emergency symptoms listed in the recommendation may lead to more referrals to 
hospital. However, people with emergency symptoms will benefit from urgent treatment 
because accelerated hypertension can be fatal if untreated. 
There may be some additional resource use from doing target organ damage tests more 
quickly and re-measuring blood pressure within 7 days. However, the number of people 
started on treatment immediately may be reduced because of undertaking investigations 
first. 
The population with severe hypertension is very small, and the proportion with severe 
hypertension and additional symptoms that suggest accelerated hypertension is even 
smaller; therefore, resource impact is unlikely to be substantial.

Context 
High blood pressure (hypertension) is one of the most important, treatable causes of 
premature morbidity and mortality in the world. It is a major risk factor for stroke, 
myocardial infarction, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, cognitive decline and 
premature death. In 2015, it was reported that high blood pressure affected more than 1 in 
4 adults in England (31% of men; 26% of women) – around 13.5 million people – and 
contributed to 75,000 deaths. The clinical management of hypertension accounts for 12% 
of visits to primary care and up to £2.1 billion of healthcare expenditure. Managing the 
cardiovascular events caused by hypertension also consumes considerable resources. 
The guideline covers adults (over 18 years) with suspected or diagnosed hypertension, 
including those with type 2 diabetes. 
2019 update 
Between 2010 and 2020, progress has been made to improve the diagnosis and 
management of hypertension: the population average blood pressure in England has fallen 
by about 3 mmHg systolic and the proportion of adults with untreated high blood pressure 
has decreased. However, the Public Health England Blood Pressure Action Plan called for 
further action to reduce the population average blood pressure by 5 mmHg through 
improved prevention, detection and management (Public Health England's Tackling high 
blood pressure: from evidence into action, 2015 and Tackling high blood pressure: an 
update, 2018). 
Since the publication of the 2011 NICE guideline on hypertension, new studies have been 
published in key areas of management; in particular, the optimal method and threshold for 
diagnosis of hypertension, managing blood pressure in lower risk populations and reducing 
blood pressure to lower targets in people with hypertension (including those with type 2 
diabetes). The updated guideline makes new recommendations in these areas, based on 
the evidence, that aim to improve care and reduce variation in current practice. 
Treating resistant hypertension (when more than 3 drugs are needed to treat 
hypertension) remains challenging. New data was also reviewed in this area and the 
recommendations updated. 
There is uncertainty in current practice about which people with symptomatic very high

Update information 
November 2023: We updated recommendations 1.1.5, 1.1.6 and 1.4.16 and made 2 new 
recommendations (1.1.7 and 1.1.8) on how to measure and manage postural hypotension 
(see the February 2023 surveillance report). We also added 2 tables to the section on 
monitoring treatment and blood pressure targets to summarise blood pressure targets in 
this guideline and NICE's guidelines on type 1 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (see 
the November 2023 surveillance report). 
March 2022: We have reviewed the evidence on blood pressure targets for people with 
cardiovascular disease, and made a new recommendation. This is marked [2022]. 
We have also reassessed the evidence on antihypertensive drug treatment, and made a 
new recommendation for people with cardiovascular disease. This is marked [2022]. 
For recommendations ending [2019, amended 2022], we have not reviewed the evidence 
for people without cardiovascular disease. We have made minor changes to the wording of 
the recommendations without changing the intent. For an explanation of these changes, 
see the rationale and impact section on blood pressure targets for people with 
cardiovascular disease. 
August 2019: We have reviewed the evidence and made new recommendations on 
diagnosis, monitoring and drug treatment for hypertension, and identifying who to refer for 
same-day specialist review. These recommendations are marked [2019]. 
We have also made some changes without an evidence review: 
• the information on cuff size for measuring blood pressure was moved to avoid 
repetition 
• plasma glucose testing was replaced with glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C) to reflect 
current practice 
• a note was added because of concerns about the risks of salt substitutes in some 
groups 
• the information on when to refer to the hypertension in pregnancy guideline was made 
clearer.

Recommendations marked [2004], [2006], [2008], [2009] and [2011] last had an 
evidence review in that year. In some cases minor changes have been made to the 
wording to bring the language and style up to date, without changing the meaning. 
Recommendations 1.2.11 and 1.4.24 (marked [2009]) were originally published in 
section 1.4 of NICE's guideline on type 2 diabetes in adults, which was updated by this 
guideline. 
Minor changes since publication 
June 2024: We corrected recommendation 1.4.26 to read 'antihypertensive' instead of 
'hypertensive'. 
October 2023: We corrected a link to an evidence review. 
July 2022: In recommendation 1.5.1 we clarified the options for people with a blood 
pressure of 180/120 mmHg or more and no target organ damage. 
November 2021: We added a link to the blood pressure@home scheme in 
recommendation 1.4.17. 
December 2019: Recommendation 1.4.13 was amended to clarify that it applies to adults 
over 80 with stage 1 hypertension. We also made changes to introductory text to clarify 
that recommendations apply to all adults, including those with type 2 diabetes, unless 
links to other NICE guidelines indicate that treatment differs.

Your responsibility 
The recommendations in this guideline represent the view of NICE, arrived at after careful 
consideration of the evidence available. When exercising their judgement, professionals 
and practitioners are expected to take this guideline fully into account, alongside the 
individual needs, preferences and values of their patients or the people using their service. 
It is not mandatory to apply the recommendations, and the guideline does not override the 
responsibility to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual, in 
consultation with them and their families and carers or guardian. 
All problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment 
or in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory 
Agency using the Yellow Card Scheme. 
Local commissioners and providers of healthcare have a responsibility to enable the 
guideline to be applied when individual professionals and people using services wish to 
use it. They should do so in the context of local and national priorities for funding and 
developing services, and in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate 
unlawful discrimination, to advance equality of opportunity and to reduce health 
inequalities. Nothing in this guideline should be interpreted in a way that would be 
inconsistent with complying with those duties. 
Commissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally 
sustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental 
impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible.

This guideline replaces NG80. 
This guideline is the basis of QS181 and QS25. 
This guideline should be read in conjunction with NG244. 
Overview 
This guideline covers diagnosing, monitoring and managing asthma in adults, young 
people and children. It aims to improve the accuracy of diagnosis, help people to control 
their asthma and reduce the risk of asthma attacks. It does not cover managing severe 
asthma or acute asthma attacks. 
Last reviewed: 27 November 2024 
This is a new collaborative guideline developed jointly by the British Thoracic Society 
(BTS), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and Scottish Intercollegiate 
Guidelines Network (SIGN). 
It updates and replaces NICE guideline 80 (published November 2017) and parts of BTS/
SIGN British guideline SIGN 158 (published July 2019). It also updates and replaces NICE 
technology appraisal guidance 10, 38,131 and 138, and NICE diagnostics guidance 12. 
We reviewed the evidence and made new or updated recommendations on diagnosis, 
treatment and monitoring. We also updated some recommendations without an evidence 
review. For full details see update information. 
Next review: This guidance will be reviewed if there is new evidence that is likely to 
change the recommendations. 
BTS, NICE and SIGN have developed an asthma pathway, which brings together 
recommendations on diagnosing, monitoring and managing asthma in adults, young 
people and children. It aims to improve the accuracy of diagnosis, help people to control 
their asthma and reduce the risk of asthma attacks. It also covers managing difficult and 
severe asthma and acute asthma attacks.

People have the right to be involved in discussions and make informed decisions 
about their care, as described in NICE's information on making decisions about your 
care. Information about decision making is also available from Realistic medicine. 
Making decisions using NICE guidelines and Using SIGN guidelines explains how we 
use words to show the strength (or certainty) of our recommendations, information 
about prescribing medicines (including off-label use), professional guidelines, 
standards and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and safeguarding. 
In this guideline, the NHS refers to NHS England and NHS Scotland unless stated 
otherwise. The recommendations are for all age groups unless indicated otherwise in 
the heading of the guideline section. 
Health professionals should follow these NICE guidelines for people delivering care: 
• Shared decision making 
• Medicines adherence 
• Multimorbidity. 
In addition, health professionals in England should follow these NICE guidelines for 
people delivering care: 
• Medicines optimisation 
• Patient experience in adult NHS services 
• Babies, children and young people's experience of healthcare 
• Decision making and mental capacity 
In addition, health professionals in Scotland should follow Scottish Government 
guidance for people delivering care: 
• Realistic Medicine 
• Health and social care standards

• Getting it right for every child. 
1.1 Initial clinical assessment 
Clinical history 
1.1.1 
Obtain a structured clinical history in people with suspected asthma. Specifically, 
check for: 
• reported wheeze, noisy breathing, cough, breathlessness or chest tightness, 
and any variation (for example, worse during the night or early morning, or 
seasonal) in these symptoms 
• any triggers that make symptoms worse 
• a personal or family history of asthma or allergic rhinitis 
• symptoms to suggest alternative diagnoses (see the tables on alternative 
diagnoses in wheezy children and alternative diagnoses in adults in the BTS/
SIGN British guideline on the management of asthma SIGN 158.) [NICE 2017, 
BTS/SIGN 2019, amended BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
1.1.2 
Do not confirm a diagnosis of asthma without a suggestive clinical history and a 
supporting objective test. Code as suspected asthma until the diagnosis is 
confirmed. [NICE 2017, amended BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
1.1.3 
If the diagnosis of asthma is confirmed, record the basis for this in the person's 
medical records, alongside the coded diagnostic entry. [NICE 2017, amended 
BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024]

Physical examination 
1.1.4 
Examine people with suspected asthma to identify expiratory polyphonic wheeze 
and signs of other causes of respiratory symptoms but be aware that even if 
examination results are normal, the person may still have asthma. [NICE 2017] 
Initial treatment and objective tests for acute symptoms at 
presentation 
1.1.5 
Treat people immediately if they are acutely unwell or highly symptomatic at 
presentation, and perform objective tests that may help support a diagnosis of 
asthma (for example, eosinophil count, fractional exhaled nitric oxide [FeNO], 
spirometry or peak expiratory flow [PEF] before and after bronchodilator) if the 
equipment is available. [NICE 2017, amended BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
1.1.6 
If objective tests for asthma cannot be done immediately for people who are 
acutely unwell or highly symptomatic at presentation, carry them out when acute 
symptoms have been controlled, and advise people to contact their healthcare 
professional immediately if they become unwell while waiting to have objective 
tests. [NICE 2017, amended BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
1.1.7 
Be aware that the results of spirometry and FeNO tests may be affected in people 
who have been treated with inhaled corticosteroids (the test results are more 
likely to be normal). [NICE 2017] 
1.2 Objective tests for diagnosing asthma in adults, 
young people and children aged 5 to 16 with a 
history suggestive of asthma 
Adults 
See also algorithm A for a summary of objective tests for diagnosing asthma in adults and 
young people (aged over 16 years) with a history suggesting asthma.

1.2.1 
Measure the blood eosinophil count or fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) level 
in adults with a history suggestive of asthma. Diagnose asthma if the eosinophil 
count is above the laboratory reference range or the FeNO level is 50 ppb or 
more. [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
1.2.2 
If asthma is not confirmed by eosinophil count or FeNO level, measure 
bronchodilator reversibility (BDR) with spirometry. Diagnose asthma if the FEV1 
increase is 12% or more and 200 ml or more from the pre-bronchodilator 
measurement (or if the FEV1 increase is 10% or more of the predicted normal 
FEV1). [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
1.2.3 
If spirometry is not available or it is delayed, measure peak expiratory flow (PEF) 
twice daily for 2 weeks. Diagnose asthma if PEF variability (expressed as 
amplitude percentage mean) is 20% or more. [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
1.2.4 
If asthma is not confirmed by eosinophil count, FeNO, BDR or PEF variability but 
still suspected on clinical grounds, refer for consideration of a bronchial challenge 
test. Diagnose asthma if bronchial hyper-responsiveness is present. [BTS/NICE/
SIGN 2024] 
Children aged 5 to 16 
See also algorithm B for a summary of objective tests for diagnosing asthma in children 
aged 5 to 16 with a history suggesting asthma. 
1.2.5 
Measure the FeNO level in children with a history suggestive of asthma. Diagnose 
asthma if the FeNO level is 35 ppb or more. [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
1.2.6 
If the FeNO level is not raised, or if FeNO testing is not available, measure BDR 
with spirometry. Diagnose asthma if the FEV1 increase is 12% or more from 
baseline (or if the FEV1 increase is 10% or more of the predicted normal FEV1). 
[BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
1.2.7 
If spirometry is not available or it is delayed, measure PEF twice daily for 2 weeks. 
Diagnose asthma if PEF variability (expressed as amplitude percentage mean) is 
20% or more. [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024]

1.2.8 
If asthma is not confirmed by FeNO, BDR or PEF variability but still suspected on 
clinical grounds, either perform skin prick testing to house dust mite or measure 
total IgE level and blood eosinophil count. 
• Exclude asthma if there is no evidence of sensitisation to house dust mite on 
skin prick testing or if the total serum IgE is not raised. 
• Diagnose asthma if there is evidence of sensitisation or a raised total IgE 
level and the eosinophil count is more than 0.5 x 10
9 per litre. [BTS/NICE/
SIGN 2024] 
1.2.9 
If there is still doubt about the diagnosis, refer to a paediatric specialist for a 
second opinion, including consideration of a bronchial challenge test. [BTS/NICE/
SIGN 2024]

1.3 Diagnosing asthma in children under 5 
Diagnosis is hard in this age group because it is difficult to do the tests and there are no 
good reference standards. 
1.3.1 
For children under 5 with suspected asthma, treat with inhaled corticosteroids in 
line with the recommendations on medicines for initial management in children 
under 5, and review the child on a regular basis. If they still have symptoms when 
they reach 5 years, attempt objective tests (see the section on objective tests for 
diagnosing asthma in adults, young people and children aged 5 to 16). [NICE 
2017] 
1.3.2 
If a child is unable to perform objective tests when they are aged 5: 
• try doing the tests again every 6 to 12 months until satisfactory results are 
obtained 
• refer for specialist assessment if the child's asthma is not responding to 
treatment. [NICE 2017, BTS/SIGN 2019, amended BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
1.3.3 
Refer to a specialist respiratory paediatrician any preschool child with an 
admission to hospital, or 2 or more admissions to an emergency department, with 
wheeze in a 12-month period. [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
1.4 Diagnosing occupational asthma 
See the BTS clinical statement on occupational asthma. 
1.4.1 
In people with adult-onset asthma, poorly controlled established asthma, or 
reappearance of childhood asthma, check for a possible occupational component 
by asking: 
• Are symptoms the same, better or worse on days away from work? 
• Are symptoms the same, better or worse when on holiday (time away from 
work, longer than usual breaks, at weekends or between shifts)?

64

Make sure all answers are recorded for later review. [NICE 2017, BTS/SIGN 
2019, amended BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
1.4.2 
Refer people with suspected occupational asthma to an occupational asthma 
specialist. [NICE 2017] 
1.5 Monitoring asthma control 
1.5.1 
Monitor asthma control at every review. In addition to asking about symptoms, 
check: 
• time off work or school due to asthma 
• amount of reliever inhaler used, including a check of the prescription record 
• number of courses of oral corticosteroids 
• any admissions to hospital or attendance at an emergency department due 
to asthma. 
If control is suboptimal, see recommendation 1.6.1 in the section on principles 
of pharmacological treatment. [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
1.5.2 
Consider using a validated symptom questionnaire (for example, the Asthma 
Control Questionnaire, the Asthma Control Test or the Childhood Asthma Control 
Test) at any asthma review. [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
1.5.3 
Do not use regular peak expiratory flow (PEF) monitoring to assess asthma 
control unless there are person-specific reasons for doing so (for example, when 
PEF measurement is part of the personalised asthma action plan). [BTS/NICE/
SIGN 2024] 
1.5.4 
Consider fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) monitoring for adults with asthma: 
• at their regular review, and 
• before and after changing their asthma therapy. [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024]

For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how 
they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on monitoring asthma 
control. 
Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in: 
• evidence review L: symptom diary for monitoring asthma 
• evidence review M: pulmonary function monitoring in asthma 
• evidence review N: FeNO measures to monitor asthma. 
1.6 Principles of pharmacological treatment 
Licensed indications for asthma inhalers vary between different medicines, different doses 
and different devices. Not all asthma inhalers are licensed for use in line with the 
recommendations in this guideline. See NICE's information on prescribing medicines or 
SIGN's information on prescribing licensed medicines out with their marketing 
authorisation and refer to the summary of product characteristics for individual products. 
1.6.1 
Take into account and try to address the possible reasons for uncontrolled 
asthma before starting or adjusting medicines for asthma in adults, young people 
and children. These may include: 
• alternative diagnoses or comorbidities 
• suboptimal adherence (see the recommendation on adherence) 
• suboptimal inhaler technique 
• smoking (active or passive), including vaping using e-cigarettes 
• occupational exposures (see the recommendation on checking for possible 
occupational asthma). 
• psychosocial factors (for example, anxiety and depression, relationships and 
social networks)

• seasonal factors 
• environmental factors (for example, air pollution, indoor mould exposure). 
[NICE 2017, BTS/SIGN 2019, amended BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
1.6.2 
If possible, check the fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) level when asthma is 
uncontrolled. If it is raised this may indicate poor adherence to treatment or the 
need for an increased dose of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). [BTS/NICE/SIGN 
2024] 
1.6.3 
Do not prescribe short-acting beta2 agonists to people of any age with asthma 
without a concomitant prescription of an ICS. [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
1.6.4 
After starting or adjusting medicines for asthma, review the response to 
treatment in 8 to 12 weeks (see the recommendations on monitoring asthma 
control). [NICE 2017, amended BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
For a short explanation of why the committee made these 2024 recommendations 
and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on principles 
of pharmacological treatment. 
Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review P: 
drug classes for initial asthma management. 
Inhalers 
1.6.5 
Base the choice of inhaler(s) for asthma on: 
• an assessment of correct technique 
• the preference of the person receiving the treatment 
• the lowest environmental impact among suitable devices 
• the presence of an integral dose counter. 
A spacer should usually be prescribed for use with a metered dose inhaler,

particularly in children. See the patient decision aid on asthma inhalers and 
climate change. [BTS/SIGN 2019, amended BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
1.6.6 
Give people with asthma information on their inhaler treatments. This should 
include the medicines they contain, how they work, when they should be taken 
and the correct technique to use for each device. [BTS/SIGN 2019, amended 
BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
1.6.7 
Observe the person using their inhaler device (and spacer if used) to check they 
can use it properly: 
• at every asthma review, either routine or unscheduled 
• at every asthma-related consultation 
• when there is deterioration in asthma control 
• when the inhaler device is changed 
• when the person asks for it to be checked or changed. 
If the person is assessed as being unable to use a device properly, find an 
alternative. [NICE 2017, BTS/SIGN 2019, amended BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
1.6.8 
If possible, prescribe the same type of device to deliver preventer and reliever 
treatments where more than one inhaler is needed. Consider providing an 
additional metered dose short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) inhaler plus spacer for 
emergency use for children under 12 years who may be unable to activate a dry 
powder inhaler during an acute asthma attack. [BTS/SIGN 2019, amended BTS/
NICE/SIGN 2024] 
1.6.9 
Encourage people to take their used or expired inhalers to their pharmacy for 
disposal. [BTS/SIGN 2019] 
Digital inhalers 
1.6.10 
Digital inhalers are not recommended for routine use in people with asthma.

and over 
See also algorithm C for a summary of the pharmacological management of asthma in 
people aged 12 years and over. 
Initial management of newly diagnosed asthma in people aged 12 
and over 
1.7.1 
Offer a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/formoterol combination inhaler to 
be taken as needed for symptom relief (as-needed AIR therapy) to people aged 
12 and over with newly diagnosed asthma. [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
In November 2024, only certain budesonide/formoterol inhalers were licensed for 
as-needed AIR therapy in mild asthma. The use of any other ICS/formoterol 
inhalers would therefore be off-label. The current evidence supporting the use of 
budesonide/formoterol is based on the use of a dry powder inhaler. See NICE's 
information on prescribing medicines or SIGN's information on prescribing 
licensed medicines out with their marketing authorisation. 
1.7.2 
If the person needing asthma treatment presents highly symptomatic (for 
example, regular nocturnal waking) or with a severe exacerbation, start treatment 
with low-dose MART (maintenance and reliever therapy) in addition to treating 
the acute symptoms as indicated (that is, a course of oral corticosteroids may be 
needed). Consider stepping down to as-needed AIR therapy using a low-dose 
ICS/formoterol inhaler at a later date if their asthma is controlled. [BTS/NICE/

1.7.3 
Offer low-dose MART to people aged 12 and over with asthma that is not 
controlled on a low-dose ICS/formoterol combination inhaler used only as 
needed. [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
1.7.4 
Offer moderate-dose MART to people aged 12 and over with asthma that is not 
controlled on low-dose MART. [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
1.7.5 
For people aged 12 and over with asthma that is not controlled on moderate-dose 
MART despite good adherence: 
• Check the fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) level if available, and the 
blood eosinophil count. If either of these is raised, refer to a specialist in 
asthma care. 
• If neither FeNO or eosinophil count is raised, consider a trial of either a 
leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) or a long-acting muscarinic receptor 
antagonist (LAMA) used in addition to moderate-dose MART. Give the 
medicine for a trial period of 8 to 12 weeks unless there are side effects. At 
the end of the trial: 
－ if asthma is controlled, continue the treatment 
－ if control has improved but is still inadequate, continue the treatment and 
start a trial of the other medicine (LTRA or LAMA)

• if control has not improved, stop the LTRA or LAMA and start a trial of the 
alternative medicine (LTRA or LAMA). [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
November 2024: Follow the MHRA safety advice on the risk of 
neuropsychiatric reactions in people taking montelukast. 
1.7.6 
Refer people to a specialist in asthma care when asthma is not controlled despite 
treatment with moderate-dose MART, and trials of an LTRA and a LAMA. (See the 
Accelerated Access Collaborative consensus pathway on the management of 
uncontrolled asthma in adults.) [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024]

Transferring people aged 12 and over from other treatment 
pathways 
These recommendations are for people with uncontrolled asthma who are on the 
treatment pathway recommended by previous NICE and BTS/SIGN guidelines. 
1.7.7 
Change treatment for people with confirmed asthma who are currently using a 
short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) only to a low-dose ICS/formoterol combination 
inhaler used as needed (as-needed AIR therapy). [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
1.7.8 
Consider changing treatment to low-dose MART for people with asthma that is 
not controlled on: 
• regular low-dose ICS plus SABA as needed 
• regular low-dose ICS/LABA (long-acting beta2 agonist) combination inhaler 
plus SABA as needed

• regular moderate-dose ICS and supplementary therapy (LTRA or LAMA, or 
both) plus SABA as needed 
• regular moderate-dose ICS/LABA combination inhaler and supplementary 
therapy (LTRA or LAMA, or both) plus SABA as needed. [BTS/NICE/SIGN 
2024] 
1.7.10 
When changing from low- or moderate-dose ICS (or ICS/LABA combination 
inhaler) plus supplementary therapy to MART, consider whether to stop or 
continue the supplementary therapy based on the degree of benefit achieved 
when first introduced. [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024]

as needed, as long as they are assessed to have the ability to manage a MART 
regimen. [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
In November 2024, no asthma inhalers were licensed for MART in children under 
12, so this use would be off-label. The current evidence supporting the use of

Consider increasing to paediatric moderate-dose MART if asthma is not 
controlled on paediatric low-dose MART. [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
Conventional pathway 
1.8.4 
Consider adding a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) to twice daily 
paediatric low-dose ICS plus SABA as needed when a child has uncontrolled 
asthma and is assessed as unable to manage the MART regimen. Give the LTRA 
for a trial period of 8 to 12 weeks (unless there are side effects), then stop it if it 
is ineffective. [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
November 2024: Follow the MHRA safety advice on the risk of neuropsychiatric

1.9 Pharmacological management in children under 
5 
These recommendations are for children under 5 with newly suspected or confirmed 
asthma, or with asthma symptoms that are uncontrolled on their current treatment. 
See also algorithm E for a summary of the pharmacological management of asthma in 
children under 5. 
1.9.1 
Consider an 8 to12 week trial of twice-daily paediatric low-dose inhaled 
corticosteroid (ICS) as maintenance therapy (with a short-acting beta2 agonist 
[SABA] for reliever therapy) in children under 5 with suspected asthma and: 
• symptoms at presentation that indicate the need for maintenance therapy 
(for example, interval symptoms in children with another atopic disorder), or 
• severe acute episodes of difficulty breathing and wheeze (for example, 
requiring hospital admission, or needing 2 or more courses of oral 
corticosteroids). [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
1.9.2 
If symptoms do not resolve during the trial period, take the following sequential 
steps: 
• check inhaler technique and adherence 
• check whether there is an environmental source of their symptoms (for 
example mould in the home, cold housing, smokers or indoor air pollution) 
• review whether an alternative diagnosis is likely.

64

If none of these explain the failure to respond to treatment, refer the child to 
a specialist in asthma care. [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
1.9.3 
Consider stopping ICS and SABA treatment after 8 to 12 weeks if symptoms are 
resolved. Review the symptoms after a further 3 months. [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
1.9.4 
If symptoms resolve during the trial period, but then: 
• symptoms recur by the 3-month review, or 
• the child has an acute episode requiring systemic corticosteroids or 
hospitalisation, restart regular ICS (begin at a paediatric low dose and titrate 
up to a paediatric moderate dose if needed) with SABA as needed and 
consider a further trial without treatment after reviewing the child within 12 
months. [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
1.9.5 
If suspected asthma is uncontrolled in children under 5 on a paediatric moderate 
dose of ICS as maintenance therapy (with SABA as needed), consider a 
leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) in addition to the ICS. Give the LTRA for a 
trial period of 8 to 12 weeks (unless there are side effects), then stop it if it is 
ineffective. [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
November 2024: Follow the MHRA safety advice on the risk of neuropsychiatric 
reactions in people taking montelukast. 
1.9.6 
If suspected asthma is uncontrolled in children under 5 on a paediatric moderate 
dose of ICS as maintenance therapy and a trial of an LTRA has been unsuccessful 
or not tolerated, stop the LTRA and refer the child to a specialist in asthma care 
for further investigation and management. [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024]

1.10 Decreasing maintenance therapy 
1.10.1 
At annual review discuss with the person with asthma (or their family or carer, if 
appropriate) the potential risks and benefits of decreasing their maintenance 
therapy when their asthma has been well controlled on their current maintenance 
therapy. [NICE 2017, BTS/SIGN 2019, amended BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
1.10.2 
When decreasing maintenance therapy: 
• Stop or reduce dose of medicines in an order that takes into account the 
clinical effectiveness when introduced, side effects and the person's 
preference. 
• Allow at least 8 to 12 weeks before considering a further treatment reduction. 
• If considering step-down treatment for people aged 12 and over who are 
using low-dose maintenance inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) plus a short-acting 
beta2 agonist (SABA) as needed or low-dose MART (maintenance and 
reliever therapy), step down to low-dose ICS/formoterol combination inhaler 
as needed (as-needed AIR therapy). [NICE 2017, BTS/SIGN 2019, amended 
BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
1.10.3 
Agree with the person (or their family or carer if appropriate) how the effects of 
decreasing maintenance therapy will be monitored and reviewed, including self-
monitoring and follow-up with a healthcare professional. [NICE 2017] 
1.10.4 
Review and update the person's asthma action plan when decreasing 
maintenance therapy. [NICE 2017] 
1.11 Adherence 
1.11.1 
Check adherence, using prescription records, and inhaler technique at every 
asthma-related healthcare review. Use the principles outlined in the NICE 
guidelines on shared decision making (endorsed by SIGN for use in Scotland) and 
medicines adherence. [NICE 2017, BTS/SIGN 2019]

1.12 Asthma in pregnancy and breastfeeding 
For recommendations on intrapartum care, see the NICE guideline on intrapartum care for 
women with existing medical conditions or obstetric complications and their babies. 
Pregnancy 
1.12.1 
People with asthma should have an asthma review during early pregnancy and in 
the postpartum period. Emphasise the importance and safety of maintaining 
good control of asthma during pregnancy and of continuing asthma medicines to 
avoid problems for themselves and their baby. [BTS/SIGN 2019] 
1.12.2 
Advise anyone who is pregnant and who smokes about the dangers for 
themselves and their babies and give appropriate support to stop smoking. See 
the NICE guideline on tobacco for more information. [BTS/SIGN 2019] 
1.12.3 
Advise using the following medicines as normal during pregnancy: 
• short-acting and long-acting beta2 agonists 
• inhaled corticosteroids 
• oral theophyllines. [BTS/SIGN 2019] 
1.12.4 
Offer oral corticosteroids during pregnancy if needed to treat exacerbations of 
asthma. Advise that the benefits of treatment with oral corticosteroids outweigh 
the risks. [BTS/SIGN 2019, amended BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
1.12.5 
If leukotriene receptor antagonists or long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonists 
are needed to achieve asthma control, they should not be stopped during 
pregnancy. [BTS/SIGN 2019, amended BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
Breastfeeding 
1.12.6 
Use medicines as normal when breastfeeding in line with recommendations in the 
BNF. [BTS/SIGN 2019, amended BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024]

1.13 Asthma in adolescents 
For guidance on transitioning to adult services, see the NICE guideline on transition from 
children's to adults' services for young people using health or social care services and the 
Scottish Parliament Information Centre briefing on transitions of young people with service 
and care needs between child and adult services in Scotland. 
1.13.1 
Discuss future career choices with adolescents with asthma and highlight 
occupations that might increase susceptibility to work-related asthma symptoms. 
[BTS/SIGN 2019] 
1.13.2 
Ask adolescents with asthma if they vape or smoke and encourage them to stop. 
If they smoke, give them advice and signpost them to local NHS stop smoking 
services. [BTS/SIGN 2019, amended BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
1.13.3 
Ask about factors that may affect a person's use of their inhaler device in real life 
settings, such as school and social situations. [BTS/SIGN 2019] 
1.14 Self-management 
1.14.1 
For adults, young people and children aged 5 and over with a diagnosis of asthma 
(and their families or carers, if appropriate): 
• Offer an asthma self-management programme, comprising a documented 
personalised action plan and education. In adults, they may be based on 
symptoms or peak expiratory flow (or both); symptom-based plans are 
usually preferred for children. 
• Explain that there are things that can trigger asthma symptoms and 
exacerbations, including indoor and outdoor pollution. Include in the 
personalised action plan approaches for minimising exposure to air pollution 
and any other personal triggers. For more guidance on how to minimise 
exposure and the effect of air pollution on health, see the recommendations 
on:

－ people with asthma, other respiratory conditions or cardiovascular 
conditions in the NICE guideline on indoor air quality at home, and 
• smoking in the NICE guideline on tobacco. [NICE 2017, amended 2021; BTS/
SIGN 2019, amended BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
1.14.2 
Review the content of the personalised action plan, and check that the person 
understands it, at the following: 
• hospital admission, including in virtual wards 
• acute consultations in primary care or emergency department 
• annual reviews. [BTS/SIGN 2019, amended BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
1.14.3 
Consider an asthma self-management programme, comprising a written 
personalised action plan (including approaches to minimising exposure to indoor 
and outdoor air pollution) and education, for the families or carers of children 
under 5 with suspected or confirmed asthma. [NICE 2017, amended NICE 2021] 
1.14.4 
For adults (aged 17 and over) who are using an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) in a 
single inhaler, offer an increased dose of ICS for 7 days, within a self-
management programme, when asthma control deteriorates. Clearly outline in the 
person's asthma action plan how and when to do this, and what to do if 
symptoms do not improve. 
When increasing ICS treatment: 
• consider quadrupling the regular ICS dose 
• do not exceed the maximum licensed daily dose. [NICE 2017] 
1.14.5 
Include advice in self-management programmes on contacting a healthcare 
professional for a review if asthma control deteriorates (see the 
recommendations on monitoring asthma control). [NICE 2020, amended BTS/
NICE/SIGN 2024] 
1.14.6 
When implementing self-management interventions in primary care, take into 
account strategies to aid this, which could include:

• the use of proactive alerts to ensure routine reviews 
• structured protocols for asthma reviews 
• support from primary care and community pharmacists 
• mailing or emailing of educational resources 
• telephone calls to provide ongoing support and advice 
• IT-based education and monitoring 
• involvement of community workers to support clinical teams in deprived and/
or ethnic minority communities. [BTS/SIGN 2019] 
1.14.7 
Schools and health services should work together to provide in-school asthma 
self-management education programmes provided by appropriately trained 
personnel. [BTS/SIGN 2019] 
1.14.8 
Provide self-management education in line with the recommendations on 
education programmes in the section on enabling patients to actively participate 
in their care in the NICE guideline on patient experience in adult NHS services. 
[BTS/SIGN 2019, amended BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024]

• non-adherence to medicines 
• over-use of short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) inhalers (more than 2 inhalers 
per year) 
• needing 2 or more courses of oral corticosteroids per year 
• 2 or more visits to an emergency department or any hospital admission for 
asthma. [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024]

might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on risk-stratified care. 
Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review O: 
risk stratified care for people with asthma. 
1.16 Organisation and delivery of care 
1.16.1 
In primary care, people with asthma should be reviewed at least annually and 
after any exacerbation by a healthcare professional with appropriate training in 
asthma management. The review should incorporate a written personalised 
action plan. [BTS/SIGN 2019, amended BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] 
1.16.2 
Consider telehealthcare as an option for supporting self-management. [BTS/
SIGN 2019] 
1.16.3 
Consider computerised decision support systems for patient use to support self-
management. [BTS/SIGN 2019]

AIR therapy 
Anti-inflammatory reliever (AIR) therapy is treatment with a reliever inhaler that contains a 
combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and formoterol. When this is used in response to 
symptoms without regular maintenance therapy it is called as-needed AIR therapy. In 
November 2024 the only product licensed for as-needed AIR therapy contained 
budesonide/formoterol. 
Asthma control 
Complete control of asthma is defined as no daytime symptoms, no night-time awakening 
due to asthma, no asthma attacks, no need for rescue medication, no limitations on 
activity including exercise, normal lung function (in practical terms forced expiratory 
volume in 1 second [FEV1] and/or peak expiratory flow [PEF] more than 80% predicted or 
best), and minimal side effects from treatment. 
Atopic disorder 
Atopic disorders are allergic conditions including allergic rhinitis (hay fever), atopic 
dermatitis (eczema), allergic asthma and other specific and non-specific allergic 
conditions such as food allergies. 
Bronchial challenge test 
A test to measure airway responsiveness (bronchial responsiveness). It is performed by 
giving small increments of a bronchoconstrictor (most commonly methacholine) and 
measuring the FEV1 after each dose until it falls by a predetermined amount (usually 20% 
from baseline). 
Bronchial hyperresponsiveness 
A measure of how easily bronchospasm can be induced in the airways. It is measured 
using a bronchial challenge test. 
Bronchodilator reversibility 
A measure of the ability to reverse obstruction in the airways using medicines that widen

the airways (bronchodilators). 
Eosinophil count 
The number of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) measured in a blood sample. Their 
levels are raised in asthma and other allergic diseases, and less commonly with malignant 
diseases, parasite infections, reactions to some medicines, and a small number of rare 
diseases. 
FeNO test 
A test that measures the amount of nitric oxide (NO) present on exhalation, usually 
expressed in parts per billion. 
FEV1 
The amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs in one second (forced 
expiratory volume in one second). 
Leukotriene receptor antagonist 
A type of oral medicine that blocks cysteinyl leukotrienes, used in the treatment of asthma 
and seasonal allergies. Also known as leukotriene modifiers. 
Long-acting beta2 agonist 
A long-acting medicine that acts on beta-receptors in the airway to relax airway smooth 
muscle and relieve symptoms of asthma. 
Long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist 
A long-acting medicine that acts on muscarinic receptors in the airway to relax airway

and formoterol is used for daily maintenance therapy and the relief of symptoms as 
needed. The terms low-dose MART and moderate-dose MART refer to the dosage of the 
maintenance component of MART. People using MART do not normally need a SABA. 
Peak expiratory flow (PEF) variability 
PEF is a measure of the maximum speed of expiration, generally expressed in litres per 
minute. PEF variability is a measure of the extent to which this varies over time and can be 
expressed numerically as amplitude percentage mean. This is calculated by subtracting 
the lowest value measured each day from the highest value on the same day, and 
averaging this over the number of days on which PEF is measured 
Skin prick testing 
A test that measures the allergic response of an individual to certain specific allergens 
when a very small amount of the specific allergen is introduced into the skin (usually the 
inner forearm). 
Specialist in asthma care 
A healthcare professional with higher training in respiratory medicine and proficiency in 
the management of asthma. In the context of this guideline, this requires both the relevant 
expertise and access to the resources that enable delivery of the diagnostic and 
management pathways described in the recommendations. 
Uncontrolled asthma 
A term used when asthma is having an impact on a person's lifestyle, or is restricting their 
normal activities, because of symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath 
and chest tightness. Uncontrolled asthma can include one or both of: 
• any asthma exacerbation needing treatment with oral corticosteroids 
• frequent regular symptoms such as: 
－ needing a reliever inhaler 3 or more days per week, or 
－ having 1 or more nights per week when asthma causes night-time waking.

Rationale and impact 
These sections briefly explain why the committee made the recommendations and how 
they might affect practice. 
As this guideline applies to England and Scotland, the perspective was for both England 
and Scotland. 
Objective tests for diagnosing asthma in adults, 
young people and children aged 5 to 16 with a 
history suggestive of asthma 
Recommendations 1.2.1 to 1.2.9 
Why the committee made the recommendations 
Although evidence on symptoms and signs of asthma was not reviewed for this guideline 
update, the committee emphasised the importance of taking a good clinical history in all 
their discussions of diagnosis. Evidence on objective tests was only included if it was 
carried out in people in whom asthma was suspected on clinical grounds. Therefore, the 
recommendations for diagnostic testing should only be applied when the history and 
examination findings support a diagnosis of asthma. The committee also noted that, 
depending on the mode of presentation, other diagnoses might be considered, but they 
confined their recommendations to confirmation or exclusion of asthma. 
The committee reviewed evidence on tests of variation in airflow obstruction and markers 
of allergy separately for adults and children. They took into account the sensitivity and 
specificity of the various tests but did not base their recommendations on these measures 
alone. They noted that no test showed high enough values of both sensitivity and 
specificity to be diagnostic in all cases. However, some of them showed high specificity 
and were potentially useful as rule-in tests with a suitably high cut-off value. It was agreed 
that a combination of tests would be needed for most people. 
When considering combinations of tests, the extent to which the available tests correlate 
with one another is important because there is less benefit in performing a test that gives

similar information to a preceding one. Practical aspects were taken into account using the 
committee's knowledge and experience. These included the availability of the tests, which 
varies considerably (in particular, bronchial challenge testing is not available in primary 
care and not readily available in secondary care), the ability of people to perform the tests, 
and the acceptability of the tests to the person, which is particularly relevant in younger 
children. 
The committee also considered the cost of the available tests. However, no health 
economic study on the most cost-effective sequence or combination of tests was 
identified. Therefore, a health economic model was developed to help address this. 
The committee discussed what cut-off values should be recommended for the tests. For 
some of the tests it was agreed that it was inappropriate to state a numerical value for an 
abnormal result. For example, normal ranges for blood tests may vary slightly between 
laboratories. Therefore, for eosinophil counts and IgE levels, a raised measurement 
(suggesting asthma) should be regarded as one above the upper end of the local 
reference range. There are also several standardised methods of performing bronchial 
challenge tests, and the definition of bronchial hyperresponsiveness will be dependent on 
the method used. 
Spirometry should always be performed using an international standard protocol but the 
method of expressing reversibility after bronchodilator varies. Ideally this would be based 
on change in z-scores, but these are not measured by all spirometry equipment. Change in 
absolute values of FEV1 is arguably best given as the percentage change compared with 
the person's predicted FEV1, and using this parameter a change of 10% or more is 
abnormal. Using the more traditional means of expressing the change as a percentage of 
the baseline FEV1, increased reversibility would be 12% or more in adults and children. In 
adults, the change should also be 200 ml or more. The committee agreed to include both 
ways of measuring reversibility in its recommendations. 
An optimal cut-off value is also difficult to give for FeNO (fractional exhaled nitric oxide). 
There is good evidence that FeNO levels increase with age and with height, and ideally 
normal ranges would be available which correct for these factors. However, there are 
currently no standard charts and FeNO equipment does not give an age/height corrected 
output. Although not ideal, the committee agreed that they need to suggest a simple cut-
off value. And because FeNO is the first, and possibly the only, test in the recommended 
sequences in both adults and children they agreed that the value should be reasonably 
high so that it would be specific, acknowledging that this sacrifices a degree of sensitivity.

Cut-offs of 50 ppb in adults and 35 ppb in children were agreed. 
No evidence was available for diagnostic tests in children under 5. The age at which a 
child can co-operate with tests will vary, but the committee agreed that it is usually 
necessary to manage these children pragmatically based on symptoms and signs only. 
Adults 
Several tests showed good specificity for asthma, with values over 80% for blood 
eosinophils, FeNO (cut-off values 40-50 ppb), peak expiratory flow (PEF) variability, 
bronchial challenge tests, and spirometry with bronchodilator reversibility. However, 
sensitivity was poor for most of these, and only FeNO and bronchial challenge tests 
showed values over 70%. Although bronchial challenge is the most accurate test, overall, it 
is more costly than others and is less readily available. 
Using the health economic model, the most cost-effective diagnostic strategy was found 
to be a gradual rule-in approach. It facilitates a positive diagnosis of asthma in a broad 
population using relatively inexpensive tests and confines the more expensive bronchial 
challenge tests to the end of the sequence. 
The committee agreed that a cheap and highly specific test to rule in asthma should start 
the sequence. This should be either an eosinophil count or a FeNO measurement, but both 
need care in interpretation. For example, a raised eosinophil count can occur for other 
reasons including other allergic diseases, and FeNO is also affected by allergic diseases, 
although only those that affect the airways. Both measurements are altered in smokers. 
However, if used correctly in the presence of a history suggesting asthma, they are good 
rule-in tests. 
The second test in the sequence should be to measure spirometry with reversibility. This is 
a more specific test than it is sensitive, but it represents a test of airway function to 
complement a first test which reflects atopy and so both components of asthma will have 
been assessed. 
The committee were aware that there can be delays in accessing spirometry and FeNO 
testing, and it is hoped that access will improve. However, if these tests are not available 
or there is a significant delay in obtaining them, the committee agreed it would be 
reasonable to use PEF variability as a substitute rule-in test.

If asthma is not diagnosed at this stage, the only additional investigation that offers 
sensitivity without losing significant specificity is a bronchial challenge test. The 
committee are aware that these tests are not easily available in many areas but reasoned 
that making a positive recommendation should encourage services to improve access. 
They also noted that methacholine challenge is more sensitive than mannitol but did not 
want to further limit the recommendation. 
Children aged 5 to 16 
The committee noted that diagnostic testing is harder in children as they may find some 
tests difficult to perform and be unwilling to have blood tests. 
A separate health economic model was developed for children using children-specific 
diagnostic accuracy data and inputs. In children, testing for sensitisation to house dust 
mite via skin prick test or finding an elevated IgE both showed high sensitivity. Therefore, 
the diagnostic strategy was a rule-in–rule-out approach. This proved to be the most cost-
effective in children as it considerably reduced the proportion of children reaching the last 
stage and needing an expensive bronchial challenge test. 
The committee agreed that a cheap and highly specific test was needed first to rule in 
asthma. FeNO is a more acceptable first test in children than an eosinophil count because 
it avoids the need to take blood, and because a level of 35 ppb or more is reasonably 
specific for asthma in the presence of a suggestive history. 
The model suggested that a sensitive test should come next to rule out asthma. However, 
the committee noted that some children would not be able to have a FeNO test because 
the equipment is not available in all primary care settings, or because a minority may not 
be able to perform the necessary expiratory manouevre. They were also concerned that 
an increasing proportion of children with asthma are non-atopic and therefore unlikely to 
have a raised FeNO level. However, these children may show bronchodilator reversibility 
(BDR). It was therefore agreed that it would be appropriate to use spirometry with BDR as 
a second test for those without an elevated FeNO, or as the first test in those in whom 
FeNO could not be measured. Although this does not follow our optimal model exactly, 
including BDR at this stage is still cost-effective. 
In children with a suggestive history of asthma, both skin prick testing for sensitisation to 
house dust mite and measurement of total IgE are sensitive tests, and the committee 
agreed that one or the other should be done next. If the test is negative, asthma is highly

unlikely and can be ruled out without resorting to bronchial challenge testing. Although 
taking blood for IgE is invasive, it does have the advantage that an eosinophil count could 
also be obtained, and if this is above 0.5 x 10
9 per litre, it would support a diagnosis of 
asthma. 
The committee were aware that there can be delays in obtaining spirometry, FeNO 
measurements or skin prick testing, and that it may not be possible to get blood samples 
from some children. It is hoped that access to these tests will improve. But if the tests are 
not available or there is a significant delay in obtaining them, the committee agreed it 
would be reasonable to use PEF variability as a substitute rule-in test. 
The best single test is a bronchial challenge test, but these are also not readily available 
and cannot be done in primary care. If there is still diagnostic doubt after performing other 
tests, the committee agreed that a referral to an asthma specialist should be made for a 
second opinion, including consideration of a challenge test. 
Further research 
Although there is evidence underpinning each of the tests included in the recommended 
diagnostic sequences for adults and for children aged 5 to 16 years, the committee 
acknowledged that the sequences themselves have not been tested. The clinical and 
cost-effectiveness of the recommended diagnostic process should be formally evaluated. 
Children under 5 
The main issue in this age group is differentiating asthma from symptoms caused by 
recurrent viral infections. The committee were aware of evidence outside the review of 
diagnostic tests showing that asthma is more likely than recurrent viral wheeze when the 
episodes are frequent or severe, when they occur in the absence of other signs of viral 
illness and when the child shows other evidence of atopy. On this basis, they agreed that 
young children with recurrent wheeze and features suggesting asthma should be treated 
empirically with a low dose of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) for a period of 8 to 12 weeks. If 
this is ineffective in reducing wheezing episodes, assuming that the ICS has been given 
satisfactorily, a referral to a specialist to consider other diagnoses is appropriate. If the ICS 
is associated with improvement, this is not proof of asthma as viral wheezing can remit 
and relapse spontaneously, so the committee agreed that the ICS should be stopped. If 
symptoms then reappear within a few weeks, asthma is the more likely diagnosis and the 
ICS should be re-started.

conditions#notice-of-rights).
Page 46 of
64

In view of the difficulty in diagnosing asthma in this age group the committee also agreed 
that any child who had been admitted to hospital, or been taken to the emergency 
department twice or more, because of wheezing or breathlessness should be referred to a 
specialist respiratory paediatrician for advice on diagnosis and management. 
How the recommendations might affect practice 
The diagnostic tests recommended for both children and adults are not routinely carried 
out in current practice, with the exception of spirometry and reversibility testing, which is 
performed in some adults with suspected asthma. FeNO equipment is not available in 
some areas, but an eosinophil count and IgE level is easily obtainable everywhere. 
Bronchial challenge tests are not done in primary care and infrequently used in secondary 
care. The recommendations will increase the demand for challenge tests and initially there 
will be a capacity problem. Incorporating the recommended diagnostic sequences into 
clinical practice would therefore require significant investment. However, using the tests 
increases the accuracy of asthma diagnosis and will be cost-effective over time. 
The recommendations for children under 5 are based on a pragmatic trial of treatment, as 
is current practice. 
Return to recommendations 
Monitoring asthma control 
Recommendations 1.5.1 to 1.5.4 
Why the committee made the recommendations 
The committee agreed that there is some information that should always be obtained at a 
routine monitoring review, for example whether any courses of oral corticosteroid have 
been needed since the last review. 
Symptom questionnaires and diaries 
The committee looked at evidence on the effects of monitoring asthma control using 
symptom questionnaires given at intervals ranging from weekly to twice in 3 months. 
Although there were a small number of beneficial outcomes in individual studies, overall, 
Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (BTS, NICE, SIGN)

conditions#notice-of-rights).
Page 47 of
64

there was no clinically useful effect of the monitoring in either adults or children. The 
committee noted that the interventions were complex, as they assessed the effects not 
just of the symptom monitoring but also the therapeutic adjustments made in response to 
the questionnaire result. Nonetheless, they concluded that they should not recommend 
questionnaires used at these relatively frequent intervals. 
The committee were aware of evidence (that was not part of this review) showing that the 
results of asthma control questionnaires predict the risk of future asthma attacks. They 
therefore used their experience to recommend that questionnaires should be used as part 
of any asthma-related review. For most people this will be their annual review. 
Pulmonary function 
The committee looked for evidence on the use of spirometry and PEF monitoring as 
measures of asthma control but did not find any data on spirometry used in this context. 
There was evidence on PEF monitoring in both adults and children. The monitoring was 
typically linked to treatment changes triggered by designated thresholds of PEF and 
compared with the effects of treatment changes triggered by symptoms. In adults, regular 
PEF measurement was associated with worse quality-of-life parameters. The committee 
thought that this might be explained by regular monitoring inducing anxiety in some 
people if PEF is not consistently high, and by the inconvenience of making regular 
measurements. 
In both adults and children, PEF monitoring was associated with an increase in asthma 
attacks, which appears to be a further disadvantage of regular monitoring. The committee 
found this hard to explain as monitoring itself seems unlikely to make asthma worse. It is 
possible that PEF measurements may have led to quicker identification and appropriate 
early treatment of some attacks. However, if this is the case, one might expect to see a 
reduction in the need for hospitalisation, or time off work or school, and these potential 
benefits were not seen. 
The committee agreed that a minority of people with asthma benefit from regular 
measurement of PEF, for example those who are poor at perceiving changes in their 
airways and are therefore at risk of delaying treatment of asthma attacks. They also took 
into account evidence in adults that was not part of the formal review showing that action 
plans that incorporate PEF measurement can be beneficial. So, they recommended against 
the use of routine PEF monitoring, with the caveat that it might have value in some

circumstances. 
FeNO 
The evidence showed that, in both adults and children, regular FeNO monitoring led to a 
reduction in the number of asthma exacerbations. In children there was also a significant 
improvement in lung function. In adults, the reduction in exacerbations was achieved 
alongside an overall reduction in the dosage of maintenance ICS therapy. This was not the 
case in children, but the studies in this age group were more likely to be conducted in 
secondary or tertiary care, so it is likely that they had a higher maintenance therapy 
requirement. 
The committee concluded that FeNO monitoring was cost-effective in adults but may not 
be in children. It was not possible on the current evidence to say what the optimum 
frequency of monitoring should be, but the committee agreed that an appropriate 
opportunity would be to make a routine measurement at the person's regular review 
(which will be an annual review for most people). 
The FeNO level is a proxy measure of airway inflammation. It can therefore be very useful 
in determining how to adjust treatment, or as an indicator of treatment adherence, when a 
person with asthma has poor symptom control. Conversely, when symptom control is 
excellent and the possibility of reducing maintenance therapy arises, a normal FeNO level 
provides helpful reassurance. The committee therefore agreed that a FeNO measurement 
should be considered whenever a change in maintenance therapy might be appropriate. 
How the recommendations might affect practice 
Asthma control questionnaires are already recommended as part of an annual review. 
Therefore, no change to practice is anticipated. The recommendations on pulmonary 
function are expected to reduce the use of PEF monitoring. 
Measurement of FeNO is increasingly used in secondary care asthma clinics, but in 
primary care only a minority of GP practices have on-site access to the test. Regular FeNO 
monitoring represents a significant change in practice because most people with asthma 
are managed in primary care. This change will also carry a cost. The committee noted that 
FeNO measurement is also useful in diagnosing asthma (see section 1.2 on objective tests 
for diagnosing asthma), and increased access to the test will therefore be of dual benefit.

Principles of pharmacological treatment 
Recommendations 1.6.2 and 1.6.3 
Why the committee made the recommendations 
The evidence review showed that clinical outcomes were poorest in all age groups with 
asthma when using SABA (short-acting beta2 agonist) alone. The committee also took into 
account other evidence from several sources, including national reviews of asthma deaths 
in both adults and children, which highlighted the dangers of using SABA without ICS in 
people with asthma. They therefore recommended that SABA alone should not be used in 
people with a diagnosis of asthma. 
The previous NICE and BTS/SIGN guidelines had recommended a number of actions which 
should be taken before increasing treatment, and the committee agreed by consensus that 
a FeNO check should also be done as long as the equipment is available to do this. 
How the recommendations might affect practice 
The prescription of SABA alone has been commonplace, although this is becoming less so 
because of the publicity around asthma deaths. The recommendation will reduce its use 
further. The replacement therapies in adults and children are more expensive, but they 
should produce clinical benefits and cost savings through a reduction in exacerbations. 
Return to recommendations 
Digital inhalers 
Recommendation 1.6.10 
Why the committee made the recommendation 
The committee looked at evidence comparing the use of digital smart inhalers with usual 
care and with digital inhalers with the feedback utility switched off. The trials included 
both children and adults with asthma, and a variety of types of inhaler. The evidence

showed improvement in adherence to treatment with digital inhalers, but this did not result 
in significant improvement in measures of asthma control. In addition, there was an 
unexplained increase in hospital admissions among people using digital inhalers when 
compared with usual care. The participants in the contributing trials varied considerably in 
terms of baseline adherence and asthma control, and benefit was generally more likely in 
the studies of people with poorer baseline values. 
Digital inhalers are more expensive than conventional devices, partly because of the 
device itself and partly because of the set-up and monitoring requirements. The 
committee concluded that digital inhalers are not a cost-effective option for routine use in 
asthma. However, they are potentially valuable in selected people with asthma, for 
example those in whom the need for biologic therapy is being considered and there is a 
need to confirm good adherence. Further research is needed to identify more precisely the 
people and the circumstances in which they might be used. 
How the recommendation might affect practice 
Digital inhalers are not recommended for routine use in the NHS, and this is in line with 
current practice. 
Return to recommendations 
Medicines for the initial management of newly 
diagnosed asthma in people aged 12 and over 
Recommendations 1.7.1 and 1.7.2 
Why the committee made the recommendations 
The committee looked at evidence comparing 3 treatment options in people aged 12 and 
over with a new diagnosis of asthma. These were SABA as needed with no ICS; regular 
low-dose ICS plus SABA as needed; and a combination inhaler of an ICS (budesonide) plus 
formoterol, a fast onset long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA), used as needed (as-needed 
AIR). 
The most important difference between the groups was a reduction in severe 
exacerbations of asthma in the group using as-needed AIR therapy, and this applied to the

comparisons with both of the other treatment options. There were also fewer 
exacerbations with ICS plus SABA than with SABA alone. Apart from the difference in 
exacerbations, there were only small differences between outcomes when comparing ICS 
plus SABA as needed with as-needed AIR, and the committee did not assess these as 
clinically important. However, the evidence showed that use of ICS (either as-needed AIR 
or regular low-dose ICS plus SABA as needed) produced consistently better outcomes 
than SABA alone. 
Health economic data showed that treatment with as-needed AIR was cheaper than 
regular ICS plus SABA as needed. The committee therefore concluded that combination 
inhalers used as needed should be the preferred treatment in newly diagnosed asthma in 
adults. However, there were concerns about the minority of people with asthma in whom 
the diagnosis is first made because of an acute attack. In these particularly symptomatic 
people, the committee agreed on safety grounds that initial treatment should be given 
regularly and recommended starting the low-dose MART (maintenance and reliever 
therapy) regimen. 
How the recommendations might affect practice 
Most people aged 12 and over with newly diagnosed asthma are currently treated with 
either a SABA alone or with regular ICS plus SABA as needed. The new recommendations 
represent a significant change in practice. The use of combination inhalers is more 
expensive than SABA alone, but cheaper than regular ICS plus SABA as needed. Therefore, 
the cost impact will vary depending on the predominant form of treatment in each general 
practice. However, there should be future savings from a reduction in severe asthma 
exacerbations compared with either of the current treatment options.

first treatment step in people aged 12 and over. This was unsurprising as the advantages 
of this as initial therapy have only recently been recognised. The committee therefore had 
to consider studies of people with asthma uncontrolled on other starting treatments, either 
a SABA when used as needed as sole therapy or when used in addition to regular low-
dose ICS. They reasoned that these people would be sufficiently similar to people who are 
not controlled with as-needed AIR to allow recommendations to be made, but agreed that 
further research comparing different add-on therapies to ICS/formoterol as needed would 
be useful. 
The evidence showed that regular low-dose ICS/LABA plus SABA as needed was superior 
to regular low-dose ICS plus SABA as needed. It produced greater improvements in lung 
function, and a reduction in the number of exacerbations and the amount of reliever 
therapy needed. Low-dose MART was also better than regular low-dose ICS plus SABA as 
needed in reducing asthma exacerbations, and people on this treatment needed less 
reliever therapy. 
When low-dose ICS/LABA plus SABA as needed was compared with low-dose MART, the 
people using MART were found to have fewer exacerbations and hospital admissions. The 
committee noted that it would be simpler for people who are already using an ICS/
formoterol inhaler to start the MART regimen than to convert to new inhalers. The 
committee also considered the economic analysis done for this update and agreed that 
the MART regimen would be a cost-effective use of resources compared with low-dose 
ICS/LABA plus SABA as needed. 
If treatment with MART using a low-dose maintenance regimen does not provide adequate 
asthma control, the committee agreed that increasing the maintenance element of MART 
to moderate dose is the appropriate next step. Evidence supporting this was available 
from studies comparing moderate dose MART with both regular moderate dose ICS/LABA 
with SABA as reliever and with regular moderate dose ICS with SABA as reliever. MART 
was superior in both comparisons, most notably in reducing severe asthma exacerbations. 
If treatment with MART using a moderate-dose maintenance regimen does not provide 
adequate asthma control, the evidence on how best to increase treatment is less clear cut. 
People whose asthma is uncontrolled at this stage will be using additional doses of ICS/
formoterol for symptom relief and will effectively be on high-dose ICS. The committee 
agreed that ideally both FeNO and the eosinophil level should be checked, as well as 
carefully assessing whether the person is adhering to their prescribed treatment. If FeNO 
or eosinophil count is raised despite good adherence to this level of ICS, the risk of 
Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (BTS, NICE, SIGN)

conditions#notice-of-rights).
Page 53 of
64

adverse outcomes is relatively high and a referral to an asthma specialist for further 
assessment and management is appropriate. 
If control is inadequate but neither FeNO nor eosinophil count is raised, the committee 
considered the possible options to be the addition of either a leukotriene receptor 
antagonist (LTRA) or a long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (LAMA). Evidence was 
available looking at the addition of either an LTRA or a LAMA to baseline treatment with 
moderate-dose ICS or moderate-dose ICS/LABA, but the 2 options were only compared 
directly in 2 small studies. Although the comparison showed a reduction in exacerbations 
with a LAMA compared with an LTRA, the committee did not have much confidence in the 
result because of the small study population. They noted that it would be simpler to add 
an LTRA than a LAMA because the latter would involve needing to teach the person with 
asthma how to use an additional inhaler device, and the need for 2 inhalers is also less 
environmentally desirable. An LTRA is also cheaper, but there is a risk of significant side 
effects, particularly neuropsychiatric disturbances. It was agreed that there was no 
convincing reason to recommend one option over the other and that the person with 
asthma should decide which should be tried first after a discussion of the potential 
benefits and harms. 
If these medicines have been tried and the person's asthma continues to be inadequately 
controlled, further treatment is available using a variety of biologic agents. Use of these 
falls outside the scope of this guideline and requires specialist assessment. The committee 
therefore recommended that a referral should be made at this stage. 
How the recommendations might affect practice 
The recommendations for increasing treatment are different from current standard 
practice, but they apply to people with a new diagnosis of asthma. People with an existing 
diagnosis of asthma who are stable on their current therapy do not have to switch 
treatment. People on current pathways who need an increase in treatment will be switched 
to MART, but this is one of the current options. There should therefore not be significant 
disruption to asthma care. The new treatment steps are cost-effective for the NHS and in 
particular will reduce the number of exacerbations requiring treatment and the number of 
hospital admissions for asthma.

Transferring people aged 12 and over from other 
treatment pathways 
Recommendations 1.7.7 to 1.7.11 
Why the committee made the recommendations 
The treatment pathway recommended in this guideline update for people aged 12 and over 
relies on using MART with increasing dose of regular ICS/formoterol, depending on 
response to treatment. This is a different strategy from that recommended by previous 
guidelines (NICE and BTS/SIGN) and many people will be on treatment that is not part of 
this new pathway. The committee recognised that this will cause a problem for these 
people when their asthma is not controlled. They therefore discussed and agreed how 
treatment should be changed in these circumstances. They noted that the general advice 
about checking inhaler technique, adherence, etc. (see recommendation 1.6.1 in the 
section on principles of pharmacological treatment) before escalating treatment still 
applies here. The recommendations are not based on a specific evidence search, but the 
committee noted that people in the MART studies reviewed for recommendations 1.7.3 to 
1.7.6 (see the section on medicine combination and sequencing in people aged 12 and 
over) were taking some form of non-MART therapy before study entry and that the 
improvement shown in comparison to both baseline and to the control treatments support 
the switch to MART. 
How the recommendations might affect practice 
The recommendations will result in more people being switched to MART than to other 
treatment options, but MART is used at present, and the change should not be disruptive.

Why the committee made the recommendation 
Evidence for children aged 5 to 11 showed that regular paediatric low-dose ICS plus SABA 
as needed was superior to SABA alone, particularly in reducing exacerbations. Using 
regular ICS did not cause more side effects and was not associated with greater adrenal 
suppression. There was no evidence for ICS/formoterol combination inhalers used as 
needed in this age group. The committee therefore recommended regular paediatric low-
dose ICS as the preferred treatment option for children aged 5 to 11. However, in view of 
the evidence supporting the use of ICS/LABA as needed combination inhalers in adults, 
they made a research recommendation to test the benefits of this combination in children. 
How the recommendation might affect practice 
The recommendation for treatment of newly diagnosed asthma in children is in line with 
current practice. 
Return to recommendations 
Medicine combination and sequencing in children 
aged 5 to 11 
Recommendations 1.8.2 to 1.8.7 
Why the committee made the recommendations 
The committee recommended regular low-dose ICS plus SABA as needed as initial 
treatment for children diagnosed with asthma. Several studies were available which 
directly addressed the question of optimal add-on therapy for children whose asthma is 
not controlled on this treatment. This evidence for MART was from a single study which 
showed that MART was superior to both regular moderate-dose ICS plus SABA as needed 
and to regular low-dose ICS/LABA plus SABA as needed. It reduced the number of 
exacerbations, reduced the need for reliever inhaler and caused fewer adverse events. 
The economic analysis done for this guideline update also supported the clinical evidence 
and the committee's discussion, with the MART regimen associated with fewer costs and 
more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) than both ICS/LABA plus SABA as needed and 
ICS plus SABA as needed.

The results for the comparison of regular low-to-moderate dose ICS plus SABA as needed 
with regular low-dose ICS/LABA plus SABA as needed were equivocal, with fewer 
exacerbations on regular treatment with low-to-moderate dose ICS but more hospital 
admissions. 
The committee agreed that paediatric low-dose MART is the best treatment for a child 
whose asthma is uncontrolled on regular paediatric low-dose ICS. They noted that MART 
is currently not licensed in the UK below the age of 12, although the key study recruited 
children younger than this, with a minimum age of 4. In addition, there were concerns that 
some children might struggle to use a dry-powder inhaler when particularly breathless. 
The committee therefore agreed to recommend MART as the preferred treatment 
providing the child is able to manage the MART regimen and the healthcare professional is 
willing to prescribe it. 
For children whose asthma is uncontrolled on regular paediatric low-dose ICS and who are 
unable to manage the MART regimen, the choice of treatment would be between adding 
an LTRA, adding a LABA, or increasing the maintenance ICS dose. The evidence did not 
show one option to be clearly superior in terms of benefits or adverse events, although the 
committee noted that prescribers should warn people of possible neuropsychiatric 
problems with montelukast. (See the MHRA drug safety update on the risk of 
neuropsychiatric reactions in people taking montelukast.) The committee agreed that 
adding an LTRA to the regular ICS treatment should be tried first as this limits the child's 
exposure to ICS and is less expensive than using ICS/LABA inhalers. They used their 
knowledge and expertise to recommend further steps if asthma control is not achieved. 
The committee also agreed that if asthma control was not achieved on a regular moderate 
dose of ICS (either as paediatric moderate-dose MART or regular paediatric moderate-
dose ICS/LABA plus SABA as needed), an opinion should be sought from a specialist in 
asthma care before escalating to a paediatric high-dose ICS regimen. 
How the recommendations might affect practice 
The recommendation for MART as the preferred step-up treatment is new, but this is not 
intended for children who are stable on current therapy, and introducing it should not be 
disruptive. It will bring advantages in terms of reducing asthma attacks. In addition, MART 
will not be suitable for some children, and the recommendations for treatment in this group 
are in line with current practice. Overall, the changes are modest and will be cost-effective 
for the NHS.

Return to recommendations 
Pharmacological management in children under 5 
Recommendations 1.9.1 to 1.9.6 
Why the committee made the recommendations 
Evidence was available for 5 treatment options: SABA alone used as needed; regular ICS 
plus SABA as needed; SABA/ICS combination inhaler used as needed; regular SABA/ICS 
combination inhaler; and regular montelukast. The evidence did not encompass all 
possible comparisons of the 5 options, but overall, those that included the use of an ICS 
clearly showed greater benefits than those without an ICS, and regular ICS (either ICS 
alone or ICS/SABA) was superior to intermittent ICS/SABA. The most important benefits of 
regular ICS were seen in reducing exacerbations or hospital admissions. There was no 
advantage to using regular ICS/SABA instead of regular ICS alone. 
In making recommendations for this age group, the committee took into account the 
difficulty of making a firm diagnosis of asthma. Episodes of cough and wheezing can occur 
with recurrent viral infections and be difficult to distinguish from asthma, and there are 
concerns about treating young children with long-term ICS when they may not need them. 
The committee were aware of evidence outside the review of diagnostic tests showing 
that asthma is more likely than recurrent viral wheeze when the episodes are frequent or 
severe, when they occur in the absence of other signs of viral illness and when the child 
shows other evidence of atopy. They made recommendations on the staged introduction 
of ICS as part of the diagnostic process in infants. They agreed that young children with 
recurrent wheeze and features suggesting asthma should be treated empirically with a low 
dose of ICS for 8 to 12 weeks, and then this can be stopped. If symptoms soon re-appear 
after stopping ICS, this suggests that the ICS was beneficial rather than the improvement 
being due to the natural remission of a viral episode. Once the presence of asthma is 
established with reasonable certainty the committee agreed that regular paediatric low-
dose ICS should be restarted, with subsequent steps added if needed. 
As diagnosis in this age group is so difficult, the committee agreed that thresholds for 
referral to an asthma specialist should be low.

current NICE recommendations. 
Return to recommendations 
Self-management 
Recommendation 1.14.5 
Why the committee made the recommendation 
The evidence for children and young people found that increasing the dose of ICS when 
asthma control deteriorates did not result in any benefits or harms compared with the 
usual dose in terms of reducing subsequent asthma exacerbations. It was limited to only 1 
study with a small number of participants who had a personalised action plan. The 
committee also looked at studies in adults, but they agreed that the evidence was not 
applicable because of the high average age of participants. 
The committee discussed the importance of a personalised action plan to guide children 
and young people if their asthma worsens and to reassure them that they are in control of 
their treatment. Children and young people who find that increasing their dose of ICS is 
helpful when their asthma control worsens should be able to continue to do this as an 
agreed strategy in their action plan. However, based on their experience, the committee 
members agreed that it is important to review the child or young person's self-
management plan if their asthma control is deteriorating. Reviews involve checking current 
medicines and inhaler technique, discussing any factors that may be triggering symptoms, 
discussing adherence and education needs, and reviewing their action plan. They should 
be carried out as needed, in addition to annual review. 
The committee discussed the importance of an individualised approach for children and 
young people, because they have varied and changing support needs at different ages. 
Studies have shown that most child asthma deaths involve children who have frequent but 
mild symptoms that are not responding to management in their personalised action plan. 
This recommendation should help to ensure that these children and young people receive 
the support that they need if they start to have problems with their asthma control.

The committee agreed that further research is needed to give clearer guidance on 
increasing the dose of ICS in children and young people within a self-management 
programme. They made a research recommendation on increasing the dose of ICS within a 
personalised self-management programme for children and young people to promote 
further research and inform future practice. 
How the recommendation might affect practice 
The recommendation will lead to an increase in the review of self-management 
programmes for children and young people and reduce the variation in current practice for 
this. The increase in resources needed for this is likely to be offset by a reduction in the 
cost of treating asthma exacerbations. 
Return to recommendations 
Risk-stratified care 
Recommendation 1.15.1 
Why the committee made the recommendation 
The studies featured differing ways of attempting to improve asthma care for people 
judged to be at high risk of adverse outcomes. Therefore, firm conclusions on the overall 
benefits were hard to reach. In addition, the factors used to identify the high-risk 
population were not identical across the different studies. The committee therefore were 
unable to define precisely how to identify people at risk, although they agreed that poor 
prescription pick-up rates, overuse of SABA inhalers and previous exacerbations needing 
unscheduled medical care are very likely to be relevant. 
Most of the studies showed some reduction in A&E attendance or hospitalisation after risk 
stratification. The committee particularly noted 2 UK studies in which at-risk patients were 
identified by alerts on GP computer systems. These indicated that risk-stratified care 
helped healthcare professionals to better identify people who needed a course of oral 
corticosteroids. This then successfully reduced the number of hospitalisations and the 
need for out-of-hours contacts and A&E attendance for asthma exacerbations. An 
associated health economic review showed that risk stratification is likely to be cost-
effective.

Based on this evidence and their clinical experience, the committee agreed there should 
be a benefit in identifying people 'at risk' of poor asthma outcomes and recommended that 
primary care services should consider introducing a risk-stratification system which then 
allows care to be adjusted according to the greater needs of some people. 
How the recommendation might affect practice 
Many general practices have some form of alert system in operation already, but others do 
not. For those, the recommendation will result in a change in practice. The committee were 
uncertain how many different systems are in current use, but in the absence of 
comparative data, they could not recommend that some practices would need to change 
from their current system.

Context 
The NICE guideline on asthma was published in 2017 and BTS/SIGN last updated their 
asthma guideline in 2019. The guidelines overlap in the clinical areas included, and 
healthcare practitioners in the UK have been using both sets of guidance. 
However, these guidelines differ in their approach to diagnosis. Concern has been raised 
about the recommendations to use fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) measurement 
and spirometry more widely, contained in NICE guidance. Likewise, there are significant 
differences in several aspects of the treatment approach in each. BTS, NICE and SIGN 
agreed that updating and unifying current guidance would be helpful for healthcare 
professionals. 
This update to national asthma guidelines is timely for people with asthma and their 
healthcare teams. There have been various initiatives that aim to improve outcomes for 
people with asthma in the UK, but outcomes nevertheless remain poor. Mortality from 
asthma continues to increase in the UK, and it remains a leading cause of morbidity. 
According to the Office for National Statistics, there were more than 1,400 asthma deaths 
in the UK in 2018, an increase of 8% compared with 2017. For outcomes to improve, people 
with asthma need excellent, evidence-based care. 
There are many uncertainties about the best way to diagnose, monitor and treat asthma. 
For example, there have been recent developments in our understanding of the value of 
physiological tests. Also, there are new options for the use of inhaled corticosteroids and 
what to do when treatment needs to be stepped up or down. The evidence in these areas 
of uncertainty has been reviewed and the relevant recommendations updated.

Update information 
November 2024: We have reviewed the evidence and made new recommendations on 
diagnosis, treatment and monitoring for people with asthma. These recommendations are 
marked [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024]. 
We have also made some changes without an evidence review. These are marked [NICE 
2020, amended BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024], [BTS/SIGN 2019, amended BTS/NICE/SIGN 
2024], [NICE 2017, amended BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024] or [NICE 2017, BTS/SIGN 2019, 
amended BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024]. We have updated the wording in line with current best 
practice. 
We have also made some minor changes – for example for clarity or where 
recommendations have been amalgamated. These recommendations are marked [NICE 
2017], [NICE 2017, amended NICE 2021] or [BTS/SIGN 2019]. 
March 2021: In recommendations 1.14.1 and 1.14.3, NICE clarified that approaches to 
minimising indoor air pollution and reducing exposure to outdoor air pollution should be 
included in a personalised action plan because pollution can trigger and exacerbate 
asthma. 
February 2020: NICE reviewed the evidence on increasing the dose of inhaled 
corticosteroids within a self-management programme in children and young people with 
asthma and removed a recommendation. A new recommendation on self-management in 
children and young people was made. This recommendation is marked [2020, amended 
BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024].
